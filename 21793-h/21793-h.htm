<p>I am sorry not to have been able to persuade my old friend, 
George Radford, who wrote the paper on &lsquo;Falstaff&rsquo; in 
the former volume, to contribute anything to the second series of
<i>Obiter Dicta</i>.&nbsp; In order to enjoy the pleasure of 
reading your own books over and over again, it is essential that 
they should be written either wholly or in part by somebody 
else.</p>
<p>Critics will probably be found ready to assert that this 
little book has no right to exist, since it exhibits nothing 
worthy of the name of research, being written by one who has 
never been inside the reading-room of the British Museum.&nbsp; 
Neither does it expound any theory, save the unworthy one that 
literature ought to <!-- page vi--><a name="pagevi"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. vi</span>please; nor does it so much as 
introduce any new name or forgotten author to the attention of 
what is facetiously called &lsquo;the reading public.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But I shall be satisfied with a mere <i>de facto</i> existence
for the book, if only it prove a little interesting to men and 
women who, called upon to pursue, somewhat too rigorously for 
their liking, their daily duties, are glad, every now and again, 
when their feet are on the fender, and they are surrounded by 
such small luxuries as their theories of life will allow them to 
enjoy, to be reminded of things they once knew more familiarly 
than now, of books they once had by heart, and of authors they 
must ever love.</p>
<p>The first two papers are here printed for the first time; the 
others have been so treated before, and now reappear, pulled 
about a little, with the kind permission of the proper 
parties.</p>

<h2><!-- page 1--><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
1</span>JOHN MILTON.</h2>
<p>It is now more than sixty years ago since Mr. Carlyle took 
occasion to observe, in his Life of Schiller, that, except the 
Newgate Calendar, there was no more sickening reading than the 
biographies of authors.</p>
<p>Allowing for the vivacity of the comparison, and only 
remarking, with reference to the Newgate Calendar, that its 
compilers have usually been very inferior wits, in fact 
attorneys, it must be owned that great creative and inventive 
genius, the most brilliant gifts of bright fancy and happy 
expression, and a glorious imagination, well-nigh seeming as if 
it must be inspired, have too often been found most unsuitably 
lodged in ill-living and scandalous mortals.&nbsp; Though few 
things, even in what is called Literature, are more disgusting 
than to hear small critics, who earn their bite and sup by acting
as the self-appointed showmen of the <!-- page 2--><a 
name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>works of their 
betters, heaping terms of moral opprobrium upon those whose 
genius is, if not exactly a lamp unto our feet, at all events a 
joy to our hearts,&mdash;still, not even genius can repeal the 
Decalogue, or re-write the sentence of doom, &lsquo;He which is 
filthy, let him be filthy still.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is therefore 
permissible to wish that some of our great authors had been 
better men.</p>
<p>It is possible to dislike John Milton.&nbsp; Men have been 
found able to do so, and women too; amongst these latter his 
daughters, or one of them at least, must even be included.&nbsp; 
But there is nothing sickening about his biography, for it is the
life of one who early consecrated himself to the service of the 
highest Muses, who took labour and intent study as his portion, 
who aspired himself to be a noble poem, who, Republican though he
became, is what Carlyle called him, the moral king of English 
literature.</p>
<p>Milton was born in Bread Street, Cheapside, on the 9th of 
December, 1608.&nbsp; This is most satisfactory, though indeed 
what might have been expected.&nbsp; There is a notable 
disposition nowadays, amongst the meaner-minded provincials, to 
carp and gird at the claims of London to be considered the 
mother-city of the Anglo-Saxon race, to regret her pre-eminence, 
and sneer at <!-- page 3--><a name="page3"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 3</span>her fame.&nbsp; In the matters of 
municipal government, gas, water, fog, and snow, much can be 
alleged and proved against the English capital, but in the domain
of poetry, which I take to be a nation&rsquo;s best guaranteed 
stock, it may safely be said that there are but two shrines in 
England whither it is necessary for the literary pilgrim to carry
his cockle hat and shoon&mdash;London, the birthplace of Chaucer,
Spenser, Ben Jonson, Milton, Herrick, Pope, Gray, Blake, Keats, 
and Browning, and Stratford-upon-Avon, the birthplace of 
Shakespeare.&nbsp; Of English poets it may be said generally they
are either born in London or remote country places.&nbsp; The 
large provincial towns know them not.&nbsp; Indeed, nothing is 
more pathetic than the way in which these dim, destitute places 
hug the memory of any puny whipster of a poet who may have been 
born within their statutory boundaries.&nbsp; This has its 
advantages, for it keeps alive in certain localities fames that 
would otherwise have utterly perished.&nbsp; Parnassus has 
forgotten all about poor Henry Kirke White, but the lace 
manufacturers of Nottingham still name him with whatever degree 
of reverence they may respectively consider to be the due of 
letters.&nbsp; Manchester is yet mindful of Dr. John Byrom.&nbsp;
Liverpool clings to Roscoe.</p>
<p><!-- page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
4</span>Milton remained faithful to his birth-city, though, like 
many another Londoner, when he was persecuted in one house he 
fled into another.&nbsp; From Bread Street he moved to St. 
Bride&rsquo;s Churchyard, Fleet Street; from Fleet Street to 
Aldersgate Street; from Aldersgate Street to the Barbican; from 
the Barbican to the south side of Holborn; from the south side of
Holborn to what is now called York Street, Westminster; from York
Street, Westminster, to the north side of Holborn; from the north
side of Holborn to Jewin Street; from Jewin Street to his last 
abode in Bunhill Fields.&nbsp; These are not vain repetitions if 
they serve to remind a single reader how all the enchantments of 
association lie about him.&nbsp; Englishwomen have been found 
searching about Florence for the street where George Eliot 
represents Romola as having lived, who have admitted never having
been to Jewin Street, where the author of <i>Lycidas</i> and 
<i>Paradise Lost</i> did in fact live.</p>
<p>Milton&rsquo;s father was the right kind of father, amiable, 
accomplished, and well-to-do.&nbsp; He was by business what was 
then called a scrivener, a term which has received judicial 
interpretation, and imported a person who arranged loans on 
mortgage, receiving a commission for so doing.&nbsp; <!-- page 
5--><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>The 
poet&rsquo;s mother, whose baptismal name was Sarah (his father 
was, like himself, John), was a lady of good extraction, and 
approved excellence and virtue.&nbsp; We do not know very much 
about her, for the poet was one of those rare men of genius who 
are prepared to do justice to their fathers.&nbsp; Though Sarah 
Milton did not die till 1637, she only knew her son as the author
of <i>Comus</i>, though it is surely a duty to believe that no 
son would have poems like <i>L&rsquo;Allegro</i> and <i>Il 
Penseroso</i> in his desk, and not at least once produce them and
read them aloud to his mother.&nbsp; These poems, though not 
published till 1645, were certainly composed in his 
mother&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; She died before the troubles began, 
the strife and contention in which her well-graced son, the poet,
the dreamer of all things beautiful and cultured, the author of 
the glancing, tripping measure&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Haste thee, nymph, and bring with thee<br 
/>
Jest and youthful jollity&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>was destined to take a part, so eager and so fierce, and for 
which he was to sacrifice twenty years of a poet&rsquo;s 
life.</p>
<p>The poet was sent to St. Paul&rsquo;s School, where he had 
excellent teaching of a humane and <!-- page 6--><a 
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>expanding 
character, and he early became, what he remained until his sight 
left him, a strenuous reader and a late student.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Or let my lamp at midnight hour<br />
Be seen on some high, lonely tower,<br />
Where I may oft outwatch the Bear.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whether the maid who was told off by the elder Milton to sit 
up till twelve or one o&rsquo;clock in the morning for this 
wonderful Pauline realized that she was a kind of doorkeeper in 
the house of genius, and blessed accordingly, is not known, and 
may be doubted.&nbsp; When sixteen years old Milton proceeded to 
Christ&rsquo;s College, Cambridge, where his memory is still 
cherished; and a mulberry-tree, supposed in some way to be his, 
rather unkindly kept alive.&nbsp; Milton was not a submissive 
pupil; in fact, he was never a submissive anything, for there is 
point in Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s malicious remark, that man in 
Milton&rsquo;s opinion was born to be a rebel, and woman a 
slave.</p>
<p>But in most cases, at all events, the rebel did well to be 
rebellious, and perhaps he was never so entirely in the right as 
when he protested against the slavish traditions of Cambridge 
educational methods in 1625.</p>
<p>Universities must, however, at all times prove <!-- page 
7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
7</span>disappointing places to the young and ingenuous soul, who
goes up to them eager for literature, seeing in every don a 
devotee to intellectual beauty, and hoping that lectures will, by
some occult process&mdash;the <i>genius loci</i>&mdash;initiate 
him into the mysteries of taste and the storehouses of 
culture.&nbsp; And then the improving conversation, the flashing 
wit, the friction of mind with mind,&mdash;these are looked for, 
but hardly found; and the young scholar groans in spirit, and 
perhaps does as Milton did&mdash;quarrels with his tutor.&nbsp; 
But if he is wise he will, as Milton also did, make it up again, 
and get the most that he can from his stony-hearted stepmother 
before the time comes for him to bid her his <i>Vale vale et 
&aelig;ternum vale</i>.</p>
<p>Milton remained seven years at Cambridge&mdash;from 1625 to 
1632&mdash;from his seventeenth to his twenty-fourth year.&nbsp; 
Any intention or thought he ever may have had of taking orders he
seems early to have rejected with a characteristic scorn.&nbsp; 
He considered a state of subscription to articles a state of 
slavery, and Milton was always determined, whatever else he was 
or might become, to be his own man.&nbsp; Though never in 
sympathy with the governing tone of the place, there is no reason
to suppose that Milton (any more than <!-- page 8--><a 
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>others) found 
this lack seriously to interfere with a fair amount of good solid
enjoyment from day to day.&nbsp; He had friends who courted his 
society, and pursuits both grave and gay to occupy his hours of 
study and relaxation.&nbsp; He was called the &lsquo;Lady&rsquo; 
of his college, on account of his personal beauty and the purity 
and daintiness of his life and conversation.</p>
<p>After leaving Cambridge Milton began his life, so attractive 
to one&rsquo;s thoughts, at Horton, in Buckinghamshire, where his
father had a house in which his mother was living.&nbsp; Here, 
for five years, from his twenty-fourth to his twenty-ninth 
year&mdash;a period often stormy in the lives of poets&mdash;he 
continued his work of self-education.&nbsp; Some of his Cambridge
friends appear to have grown a little anxious, on seeing one who 
had distinction stamped upon his brow, doing what the world calls
nothing; and Milton himself was watchful, and even 
suspicious.&nbsp; His second sonnet records this state of 
feeling:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;How soon hath Time, the subtle thief of 
youth,<br />
Stolen on his wing my three-and-twentieth year!<br />
My hasting days fly on with full career,<br />
But my late spring no bud or blossom shew&rsquo;th.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And yet no poet had ever a more beautiful springtide, though 
it was restless, as spring <!-- page 9--><a 
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>should be, with
the promise of greater things and &lsquo;high midsummer 
pomps.&rsquo;&nbsp; These latter it was that were postponed 
almost too long.</p>
<p>Milton at Horton made up his mind to be a great 
poet&mdash;neither more nor less; and with that end in view he 
toiled unceasingly.&nbsp; A more solemn dedication of a man by 
himself to the poetical office cannot be imagined.&nbsp; 
Everything about him became, as it were, pontifical, almost 
sacramental.&nbsp; A poet&rsquo;s soul must contain the perfect 
shape of all things good, wise, and just.&nbsp; His body must be 
spotless and without blemish, his life pure, his thoughts high, 
his studies intense.&nbsp; There was no drinking at the 
&lsquo;Mermaid&rsquo; for John Milton.&nbsp; His thoughts, like 
his joys, were not those that</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;are in widest commonalty spread.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When in his walks he met the Hodge of his period, he is more 
likely to have thought of a line in Virgil than of stopping to 
have a chat with the poor fellow.&nbsp; He became a student of 
the Italian language, and writes to a friend: &lsquo;I who 
certainly have not merely wetted the tip of my lips in the stream
of these (the classical) languages, but in proportion to my years
have swallowed the most copious draughts, can yet <!-- page 
10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
10</span>sometimes retire with avidity and delight to feast on 
Dante, Petrarch, and many others; nor has Athens itself been able
to confine me to the transparent waves of its Ilissus, nor 
ancient Rome to the banks of its Tiber, so as to prevent my 
visiting with delight the streams of the Arno and the hills of 
F&aelig;sol&aelig;.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now it was that he, in his often-quoted words written to the 
young Deodati, doomed to an early death, was meditating &lsquo;an
immortality of fame,&rsquo; letting his wings grow and preparing 
to fly.&nbsp; But dreaming though he ever was of things to come, 
none the less, it was at Horton he composed <i>Comus</i>, 
<i>Lycidas</i>, <i>L&rsquo;Allegro</i>, and <i>Il Penseroso</i>, 
poems which enable us half sadly to realize how much went and how
much was sacrificed to make the author of <i>Paradise 
Lost</i>.</p>
<p>After five years&rsquo; retirement Milton began to feel the 
want of a little society, of the kind that is &lsquo;quiet, wise,
and good,&rsquo; and he meditated taking chambers in one of the 
Inns of Court, where he could have a pleasant and shady walk 
under &lsquo;immemorial elms,&rsquo; and also enjoy the 
advantages of a few choice associates at home and an elegant 
society abroad.&nbsp; The death of his mother in 1637 gave his 
thoughts another direction, and he obtained his father&rsquo;s 
permission <!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>to travel to Italy, &lsquo;that 
woman-country, wooed not wed,&rsquo; which has been the mistress 
of so many poetical hearts, and was so of John 
Milton&rsquo;s.&nbsp; His friends and relatives saw but one 
difficulty in the way.&nbsp; John Milton the younger, though not 
at this time a Nonconformist, was a stern and unbending 
Protestant, and was as bitter an opponent of His Holiness the 
Pope as he certainly would have been, had his days been 
prolonged, of His Majesty the Pretender.</p>
<p>There is something very characteristic in this almost inflamed
hostility in the case of a man with such love of beauty and 
passion for architecture and music as always abided in Milton, 
and who could write:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;But let my due feet never fail<br />
To walk the studious cloisters&rsquo; pale,<br />
And love the high embow&egrave;d roof,<br />
With antique pillars massy-proof,<br />
And storied windows richly dight,<br />
Casting a dim, religious light.<br />
There let the pealing organ blow<br />
To the full-voiced quire below,<br />
In service high and anthems clear,<br />
As may with sweetness, through mine ear,<br />
Dissolve me into ecstasies,<br />
And bring all heaven before my eyes.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here surely is proof of an &aelig;sthetic nature beyond most 
of our modern raptures; but none the less, <!-- page 12--><a 
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>and at the 
very same time, Rome was for Milton the &lsquo;grim wolf&rsquo; 
who, &lsquo;with privy paw, daily devours apace.&rsquo;&nbsp; It 
is with a sigh of sad sincerity that Dr. Newman admits that 
Milton breathes through his pages a hatred of the Catholic 
Church, and consequently the Cardinal feels free to call him a 
proud and rebellious creature of God.&nbsp; That Milton was both 
proud and rebellious cannot be disputed.&nbsp; Nonconformists 
need not claim him for their own with much eagerness.&nbsp; What 
he thought of Presbyterians we know, and he was never a church 
member, or indeed a church-goer.&nbsp; Dr. Newman has admitted 
that the poet Pope was an unsatisfactory Catholic; Milton was 
certainly an unsatisfactory Dissenter.&nbsp; Let us be candid in 
these matters.&nbsp; Milton was therefore bidden by his friends, 
and by those with whom he took counsel, to hold his peace whilst 
in Rome about the &lsquo;grim wolf,&rsquo; and he promised to do 
so, adding, however, the Miltonic proviso that this was on 
condition that the Papists did not attack his religion 
first.&nbsp; &lsquo;If anyone,&rsquo; he wrote, &lsquo;in the 
very city of the Pope attacked the orthodox religion, I defended 
it most freely.&rsquo;&nbsp; To call the Protestant religion, 
which had not yet attained to its second century, the orthodox 
religion <!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>under the shadow of the Vatican was 
to have the courage of his opinions.&nbsp; But Milton was not a 
man to be frightened of schism.&nbsp; That his religious opinions
should be peculiar probably seemed to him to be almost 
inevitable, and not unbecoming.&nbsp; He would have agreed with 
Emerson, who declares that would man be great he must be a 
Nonconformist.</p>
<p>There is something very fascinating in the records we have of 
Milton&rsquo;s one visit to the Continent.&nbsp; A more 
impressive Englishman never left our shores.&nbsp; Sir Philip 
Sidney perhaps approaches him nearest.&nbsp; Beautiful beyond 
praise, and just sufficiently conscious of it to be careful never
to appear at a disadvantage, dignified in manners, versed in 
foreign tongues, yet full of the ancient learning&mdash;a 
gentleman, a scholar, a poet, a musician, and a 
Christian&mdash;he moved about in a leisurely manner from city to
city, writing Latin verses for his hosts and Italian sonnets in 
their ladies&rsquo; albums, buying books and music, and creating,
one cannot doubt, an all too flattering impression of an English 
Protestant.&nbsp; To travel in Italy with Montaigne or Milton, or
Evelyn or Gray, or Shelley, or, pathetic as it is, with the dying
Sir Walter, is perhaps more instructive than to go there for <!--
page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
14</span>yourself with a tourist&rsquo;s ticket.&nbsp; Old 
Montaigne, who was but forty-seven when he made his journey, and 
whom therefore I would not call old had not Pope done so before 
me, is the most delightful of travelling companions, and as easy 
as an old shoe.&nbsp; A humaner man than Milton, a wiser man than
Evelyn&mdash;with none of the constraint of Gray, or the strange,
though fascinating, outlandishness of Shelley&mdash;he perhaps 
was more akin to Scott than any of the other travellers; but 
Scott went to Italy an overwhelmed man, whose only fear was he 
might die away from the heather and the murmur of Tweed.&nbsp; 
However, Milton is the most improving companion of them all, and 
amidst the impurities of Italy, &lsquo;in all the places where 
vice meets with so little discouragement, and is protected with 
so little shame,&rsquo; he remained the Milton of Cambridge and 
Horton, and did nothing to pollute the pure temple of a 
poet&rsquo;s mind.&nbsp; He visited Paris, Nice, Genoa, Pisa, and
Florence, staying in the last city two months, and living on 
terms of great intimacy with seven young Italians, whose musical 
names he duly records.&nbsp; These were the months of August and 
September, not nowadays reckoned safe months for Englishmen to be
in Florence&mdash;modern lives <!-- page 15--><a 
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>being raised 
in price.&nbsp; From Florence he proceeded through Siena to Rome,
where he also stayed two months.&nbsp; There he was present at a 
magnificent entertainment given by the Cardinal Francesco 
Barberini in his palace, and heard the singing of the celebrated 
Leonora Baroni.&nbsp; It is not for one moment to be supposed 
that he sought an interview with the Pope, as Montaigne had done,
who was exhorted by His Holiness &lsquo;to persevere in the 
devotion he had ever manifested in the cause of the 
Church;&rsquo; and yet perhaps Montaigne by his essays did more 
to sap the authority of Peter&rsquo;s chair than Milton, however 
willing, was able to do.</p>
<p>It has been remarked that Milton&rsquo;s chief enthusiasm in 
Italy was not art, but music, which falls in with 
Coleridge&rsquo;s <i>dictum</i>, that Milton is not so much a 
picturesque as a musical poet&mdash;meaning thereby, I suppose, 
that the effects which he produces and the scenes which he 
portrays are rather suggested to us by the rhythm of his lines 
than by actual verbal descriptions.&nbsp; From Rome Milton went 
to Naples, whence he had intended to go to Sicily and Greece; but
the troubles beginning at home he forewent this pleasure, and 
consequently never saw Athens, which was surely a <!-- page 
16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>great
pity.&nbsp; He returned to Rome, where, troubles or no troubles, 
he stayed another two months.&nbsp; From Rome he went back to 
Florence, which he found too pleasant to leave under two more 
months.&nbsp; Then he went to Lucca, and so to Venice, where he 
was very stern with himself, and only lingered a month.&nbsp; 
From Venice he went to Milan, and then over the Alps to Geneva, 
where he had dear friends.&nbsp; He was back in London in August,
1639, after an absence of fifteen months.</p>
<p>The times were troubled enough.&nbsp; Charles I., whose 
literary taste was so good that one must regret the mischance 
that placed a crown upon his comely head, was trying hard, at the
bidding of a priest, to thrust Episcopacy down Scottish throats, 
who would not have it at any price.&nbsp; He was desperately in 
need of money, and the House of Commons (which had then a 
<i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i>) was not prepared to give him 
any except on terms.&nbsp; Altogether it was an exciting time, 
but Milton was in no way specially concerned in it.&nbsp; Milton 
looms so large in our imagination amongst the figures of the 
period that, despite Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s sneers, we are apt to 
forget his political insignificance, and to fancy him curtailing 
his tour and returning home to <!-- page 17--><a 
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>take his 
place amongst the leaders of the Parliament men.&nbsp; Return 
home he did, but it was, as another pedagogue has reminded us, to
receive boys &lsquo;to be boarded and instructed.&rsquo;&nbsp; 
Dr. Johnson tells us that we ought not to allow our veneration 
for Milton to rob us of a joke at the expense of a man &lsquo;who
hastens home because his countrymen are contending for their 
liberty, and when he reaches the scene of action vapours away his
patriotism in a private boarding-school;&rsquo; but that this 
observation was dictated by the good Doctor&rsquo;s spleen is 
made plain by his immediately proceeding to point out, with his 
accustomed good sense, that there is really nothing to laugh at, 
since it was desirable that Milton, whose father was alive and 
could only make him a small allowance, should do something, and 
there was no shame in his adopting an honest and useful 
employment.</p>
<p>To be a Parliament man was no part of the ambition of one who 
still aspired to be a poet; who was not yet blind to the heavenly
vision; who was still meditating what should be his theme, and 
who in the meantime chastised his sister&rsquo;s sons, unruly 
lads, who did him no credit and bore him no great love.</p>

could the permanency of Parliamentary institutions.&nbsp; None of
these things specially concerned John Milton.&nbsp; But there 
also uprose the eternal Church question, &lsquo;What sort of 
Church are we to have?&rsquo;&nbsp; The fierce controversy raged,
and &lsquo;its fair enticing fruit,&rsquo; spread round 
&lsquo;with liberal hand,&rsquo; proved too much for the father 
of English epic.</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;He 
scrupled not to eat<br />
Against his better knowledge.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, he commenced pamphleteer, and between May, 
1641, and the following March he had written five pamphlets 
against Episcopacy, and used an intolerable deal of bad language,
which, however excusable in a heated controversialist, ill became
the author of <i>Comus</i>.</p>
<p>The war broke out in 1642, but Milton kept house.&nbsp; The 
&lsquo;tented field&rsquo; had no attractions for him.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1643 he took a sudden journey into the 
country, and returned home to his boys with a wife, the daughter 
of an <!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>Oxfordshire Cavalier.&nbsp; Poor Mary
Powell was but seventeen, her poetic lord was thirty-five.&nbsp; 
From the country-house of a rollicking squire to Aldersgate 
Street was somewhat too violent a change.&nbsp; She had left ten 
brothers and sisters behind her, the eldest twenty-one, the 
youngest four.&nbsp; As one looks upon this picture and on that, 
there is no need to wonder that the poor girl was unhappy.&nbsp; 
The poet, though keenly alive to the subtle charm of a 
woman&rsquo;s personality, was unpractised in the arts of daily 
companionship.&nbsp; He expected to find much more than he 
brought of general good-fellowship.&nbsp; He had an ideal ever in
his mind of both bodily and spiritual excellence, and he was 
almost greedy to realize both, but he knew not how.&nbsp; One of 
his complaints was that his wife was mute and insensate, and sat 
silent at his board.&nbsp; It must, no doubt, have been deadly 
dull, that house in Aldersgate Street.&nbsp; Silence reigned, 
save when broken by the cries of the younger Phillips sustaining 
chastisement.&nbsp; Milton had none of that noble humanitarian 
spirit which had led Montaigne long years before him to protest 
against the cowardly traditions of the schoolroom.&nbsp; After a 
month of Aldersgate Street, Mrs. Milton begged to go <!-- page 
20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
20</span>home.&nbsp; Her wish was granted, and she ran back to 
her ten brothers and sisters, and when her leave of absence was 
up refused to return.&nbsp; Her husband was furiously angry; and 
in a time so short as almost to enforce the belief that he began 
the work during the honeymoon, was ready with his celebrated 
pamphlet, <i>The Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce restored to 
the good of both sexes</i>.&nbsp; He is even said, with his 
accustomed courage, to have paid attentions to a Miss Davis, who 
is described as a very handsome and witty gentlewoman, and 
therefore not one likely to sit silent at his board; but she was 
a sensible girl as well, and had no notion of a married 
suitor.&nbsp; Of Milton&rsquo;s pamphlet it is everyone&rsquo;s 
duty to speak with profound respect.&nbsp; It is a noble and 
passionate cry for a high ideal of married life, which, so he 
argued, had by inflexible laws been changed into a drooping and 
disconsolate household captivity, without refuge or 
redemption.&nbsp; He shuddered at the thought of a man and woman 
being condemned, for a mistake of judgment, to be bound together 
to their unspeakable wearisomeness and despair, for, he says, not
to be beloved and yet retained is the greatest injury to a gentle
spirit.&nbsp; Our present doctrine of divorce, which sets the 
<!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
21</span>household captive free on payment of a broken vow, but 
on no less ignoble terms, is not founded on the congruous, and is
indeed already discredited, if not disgraced.</p>
<p>This pamphlet on divorce marks the beginning of Milton&rsquo;s
mental isolation.&nbsp; Nobody had a word to say for it.&nbsp; 
Episcopalian, Presbyterian, and Independent held his doctrine in 
as much abhorrence as did the Catholic, and all alike regarded 
its author as either an impracticable dreamer or worse.&nbsp; It 
was written certainly in too great haste, for his errant wife, 
actuated by what motives cannot now be said, returned to her 
allegiance, was mindful of her plighted troth, and, suddenly 
entering his room, fell at his feet and begged to be 
forgiven.&nbsp; She was only nineteen, and she said it was all 
her mother&rsquo;s fault.&nbsp; Milton was not a sour man, and 
though perhaps too apt to insist upon repentance preceding 
forgiveness, yet when it did so he could forgive divinely.&nbsp; 
In a very short time the whole family of Powells, whom the war 
had reduced to low estate, were living under his roof in the 
Barbican, whither he moved on the Aldersgate house proving too 
small for his varied belongings.&nbsp; The poet&rsquo;s father 
also lived with his son.</p>
<p>Mrs. Milton had four children, three of whom, <!-- page 
22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>all 
daughters, lived to grow up.&nbsp; The mother died in childbirth 
in 1652, being then twenty-six years of age.</p>
<p>The <i>Areopagitica</i>, <i>a Speech for Unlicensed 
Printing</i>, followed the divorce pamphlet, but it also fell 
upon deaf ears.&nbsp; Of all religious sects the Presbyterians, 
who were then dominant, are perhaps the least likely to forego 
the privilege of interference in the affairs of others.&nbsp; 
Instead of the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of London,
instead of &lsquo;a lordly Imprimatur, one from Lambeth House, 
another from the west end of Paul&rsquo;s,&rsquo; there was 
appointed a commission of twenty Presbyterians to act as State 
Licensers.&nbsp; Then was Milton&rsquo;s soul stirred within him 
to a noble rage.&nbsp; His was a threefold protest&mdash;as a 
citizen of a State he fondly hoped had been free, as an author, 
and as a reader.&nbsp; As a citizen he protested against so 
unnecessary and improper an interference.&nbsp; It is not, he 
cried, &lsquo;the unfrocking of a priest, the unmitring of a 
bishop, that will make us a happy nation,&rsquo; but the practice
of virtue, and virtue means freedom to choose.&nbsp; Milton was a
manly politician, and detested with his whole soul grandmotherly 
legislation.&nbsp; &lsquo;He who is not trusted with his own 
actions, his drift not being <!-- page 23--><a 
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>known to be 
evil, and standing to the hazard of law and penalty, has no great
argument to think himself reputed in the commonwealth wherein he 
was born, for other than a fool or a foreigner.&rsquo;&nbsp; 
&lsquo;They are not skilful considerers of human things who 
imagine to remove sin by removing the matter of sin.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;And were I the chooser, a dram of well-doing should be 
preferred before many times as much the forcible hindrance of 
evil doing.&rsquo;&nbsp; These are texts upon which sermons, not 
inapplicable to our own day, might be preached.&nbsp; Milton has 
made our first parent so peculiarly his own, that any 
observations of his about Adam are interesting.&nbsp; &lsquo;Many
there be that complain of Divine Providence for suffering Adam to
transgress.&nbsp; Foolish tongues!&nbsp; When God gave him reason
He gave him freedom to choose, for reason is but choosing; he had
been else a mere artificial Adam.&nbsp; We ourselves esteem not 
of that obedience a love or gift which is of force.&nbsp; God 
therefore left him free, set before him a provoking object ever 
almost in his eyes; herein consisted his merit, herein the right 
of his reward, the praise of his abstinence.&rsquo;&nbsp; So that
according to Milton even Eden was a state of trial.&nbsp; As an 
author, <!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>Milton&rsquo;s protest has great 
force.&nbsp; &lsquo;And what if the author shall be one so 
copious of fancy as to have many things well worth the adding 
come into his mind after licensing, while the book is yet under 
the press, which not seldom happens to the best and diligentest 
writers, and that perhaps a dozen times in one book?&nbsp; The 
printer dares not go beyond his licensed copy.&nbsp; So often 
then must the author trudge to his leave-giver that those his new
insertions may be viewed, and many a jaunt will be made ere that 
licenser&mdash;for it must be the same man&mdash;can either be 
found, or found at leisure; meanwhile either the press must stand
still, which is no small damage, or the author lose his 
accuratest thoughts, and send forth the book worse than he made 
it, which to a diligent writer is the greatest melancholy and 
vexation that can befall.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Milton would have had no licensers.&nbsp; Every book should 
bear the printer&rsquo;s name, and &lsquo;mischievous and 
libellous books&rsquo; were to be burnt by the common hangman, 
not as an effectual remedy, but as the &lsquo;most effectual 
remedy man&rsquo;s prevention can use.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The noblest pamphlet in &lsquo;our English, the language of 
men ever famous and foremost in <!-- page 25--><a 
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>the 
achievements of liberty,&rsquo; accomplished nothing, and its 
author must already have thought himself fallen on evil days.</p>
<p>In the year 1645, the year of Naseby, as Mr. Pattison reminds 
us, appeared the first edition of Milton&rsquo;s Poems.&nbsp; 
Then, for the first time, were printed <i>L&rsquo;Allegro</i> and
<i>Il Penseroso</i>, the <i>Ode on the Morning of Christ&rsquo;s 
Nativity</i>, and various of the sonnets.&nbsp; The little volume
also contained <i>Comus</i> and <i>Lycidas</i>, which had been 
previously printed.&nbsp; With the exception of three sonnets and
a few scraps of translation, Milton had written nothing but 
pamphlets since his return from Italy.&nbsp; At the beginning of 
the volume, which is a small octavo, was a portrait of the poet, 
most villainously executed.&nbsp; He was really thirty-seven, but
flattered himself, as men of that age will, that he looked ten 
years younger; he was therefore much chagrined to find himself 
represented as a grim-looking gentleman of at least fifty.&nbsp; 
The way he revenged himself upon the hapless artist is well 
known.&nbsp; The volume, with the portrait, is now very scarce, 
almost rare.</p>
<p>In 1647 Milton removed from the Barbican, both his father and 
his father-in-law being dead, to a smaller house in Holborn, 
backing upon <!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields, close to 
where the Inns of Court Hotel now stands, and not far from the 
spot which was destined to witness the terrible tragedy which was
at once to darken and glorify the life of one of Milton&rsquo;s 
most fervent lovers, Charles Lamb.&nbsp; About this time he is 
supposed to have abandoned pedagogy.&nbsp; The habit of 
pamphleteering stuck to him; indeed, it is one seldom thrown 
off.&nbsp; It is much easier to throw off the pamphlets.</p>
<p>In 1649 Milton became a public servant, receiving the 
appointment of Latin Secretary to the Council of Foreign 
Affairs.&nbsp; He knew some member of the Committee, who obtained
his nomination.&nbsp; His duties were purely clerkly.&nbsp; It 
was his business to translate English despatches into Latin, and 
foreign despatches into English.&nbsp; He had nothing whatever to
do with the shaping of the foreign policy of the 
Commonwealth.&nbsp; He was not even employed in translating the 
most important of the State papers.&nbsp; There is no reason for 
supposing that he even knew the leading politicians of his 
time.&nbsp; There is a print one sees about, representing Oliver 
Cromwell dictating a foreign despatch to John Milton; but it is 
all imagination, nor is there anything to prove that Cromwell and
<!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
27</span>Milton, the body and soul of English Republicanism, were
ever in the same room together, or exchanged words with one 
another.&nbsp; Milton&rsquo;s name does not occur in the great 
history of Lord Clarendon.&nbsp; Whitelocke, who was the leading 
member of the Committee which Milton served, only mentions him 
once.&nbsp; Thurloe spoke of him as a blind man who wrote Latin 
letters.&nbsp; Richard Baxter, in his folio history of his Life 
and Times, never mentions Milton at all. <a 
name="citation27"></a><a href="#footnote27" 
class="citation">[27]</a>&nbsp; He was just a clerk in the 
service of the Commonwealth, of a scholarly bent, peculiar habit 
of thought, and somewhat of an odd temper.&nbsp; He was not the 
man to cultivate great acquaintances, or to flitter away his time
waiting the convenience of other people.&nbsp; When once asked to
use his influence to obtain for a friend an appointment, he 
replied he had no influence, &lsquo;<i>propter paucissimas 
familiaritates meas cum gratiosis</i>, <i>qui domi fere</i>, 
<i>idque libenter</i>, <i>me contineo</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; The busy 
great men of the day would have been more than astonished, they 
would have been disgusted, had they been told that posterity 
would refer to most of them compendiously, as having lived in the
age of Milton.&nbsp; But this need not trouble us.</p>
<p>On the Continent Milton enjoyed a wider <!-- page 28--><a 
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>reputation, 
on account of his controversy with the great European scholar, 
Salmasius, on the sufficiently important and interesting, and 
then novel, subject of the execution of Charles I.&nbsp; Was it 
justifiable?&nbsp; Salmasius, a scholar and a Protestant, though 
of an easy-going description, was employed, or rather, as he had 
no wages (Milton&rsquo;s hundred <i>Jacobuses</i> being 
fictitious), nominated by Charles, afterwards the Second, to 
indict the regicides at the bar of European opinion, which 
accordingly he did in the Latin language.&nbsp; The work reached 
this country in the autumn of 1649, and it evidently became the 
duty of somebody to answer it.&nbsp; Two qualifications were 
necessary&mdash;the replier must be able to read Latin, and to 
write it after a manner which should escape the ridicule of the 
scholars of Leyden, Geneva, and Paris.&nbsp; Milton occurred to 
somebody&rsquo;s mind, and the task was entrusted to him.&nbsp; 
It is not to be supposed that Cromwell was ever at the pains to 
read Salmasius for himself, but still it would not have done to 
have it said that the <i>Defensio Regia</i> of so celebrated a 
scholar as Salmasius remained unanswered, and so the appointment 
was confirmed, and Milton, no new hand at a pamphlet, set to 
work.&nbsp; In March, 1651, his first <i>Defence of the English 
<!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
29</span>People</i> was in print.&nbsp; In this great pamphlet 
Milton asserts, as against the doctrine of the divine right of 
kings, the undisputed sovereignty of the people; and he maintains
the proposition that, as well by the law of God, as by the law of
nations, and the law of England, a king of England may be brought
to trial and death, the people being discharged from all 
obligations of loyalty when a lawful prince becomes a tyrant, or 
gives himself over to sloth and voluptuousness.&nbsp; This noble 
argument, alike worthy of the man and the occasion, is doubtless 
over-clouded and disfigured by personal abuse of Salmasius, whose
relations with his wife had surely as little to do with the head 
of Charles I. as had poor Mr. Dick&rsquo;s memorial.&nbsp; 
Salmasius, it appears, was henpecked, and to allow yourself to be
henpecked was, in Milton&rsquo;s opinion, a high crime and 
misdemeanour against humanity, and one which rendered a man 
infamous, and disqualified him from taking part in debate.</p>
<p>It has always been reported that Salmasius, who was getting on
in years, and had many things to trouble him besides his own 
wife, perished in the effort of writing a reply to Milton, in 
which he made use of language <!-- page 30--><a 
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>quite as bad 
as any of his opponent&rsquo;s; but it now appears that this is 
not so.&nbsp; Indeed, it is generally rash to attribute a 
man&rsquo;s death to a pamphlet, or an article, either of his own
or anybody else&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Salmasius, however, died, though from natural causes, and his 
reply was not published till after the Restoration, when the 
question had become, what it has ever since remained, 
academical.</p>
<p>Other pens were quicker, and to their productions Milton, in 
1654, replied with his <i>Second Defence of the English 
People</i>, a tract containing autobiographical details of 
immense interest and charm.&nbsp; By this time he was totally 
blind, though, with a touch of that personal sensitiveness ever 
characteristic of him, he is careful to tell Europe, in the 
<i>Second Defence</i>, that externally his eyes were uninjured, 
and shone with an unclouded light.</p>
<p>Milton&rsquo;s <i>Defences of the English People</i> are 
rendered provoking by his extraordinary language concerning his 
opponents.&nbsp; &lsquo;Numskull,&rsquo; &lsquo;beast,&rsquo; 
&lsquo;fool,&rsquo; &lsquo;puppy,&rsquo; &lsquo;knave,&rsquo; 
&lsquo;ass,&rsquo; &lsquo;mongrel-cur,&rsquo; are but a few of 
the epithets employed.&nbsp; This is doubtless mere matter of 
pleading, a rule of the forum where controversies between <!-- 
page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
31</span>scholars are conducted; but for that very reason it 
makes the pamphlets as provoking to an ordinary reader as an old 
bill of complaint in Chancery must have been to an impatient 
suitor who wanted his money.&nbsp; The main issues, when cleared 
of personalities, are important enough, and are stated by Milton 
with great clearness.&nbsp; &lsquo;Our king made not us, but we 
him.&nbsp; Nature has given fathers to us all, but we ourselves 
appointed our own king; so that the people is not for the king, 
but the king for them.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was made a matter of great
offence amongst monarchs and monarchical persons that Charles was
subject to the indignity of a trial.&nbsp; With murders and 
poisonings kings were long familiar.&nbsp; These were part of the
perils of the voyage, for which they were prepared, but, as 
Salmasius put it, &lsquo;for a king to be arraigned in a court of
judicature, to be put to plead for his life, to have sentence of 
death pronounced against him, and that sentence 
executed,&rsquo;&mdash;oh! horrible impiety.&nbsp; To this Milton
replies: &lsquo;Tell me, thou superlative fool, whether it be not
more just, more agreeable to the rules of humanity and the laws 
of all human societies, to bring a criminal, be his offence what 
it will, before a court of justice, to give him leave to speak 
<!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
32</span>for himself, and if the law condemns him, then to put 
him to death as he has deserved, so as he may have time to repent
or to recollect himself; than presently, as soon as ever he is 
taken, to butcher him without more ado?&rsquo;</p>
<p>But a king of any spirit would probably answer that he 
preferred to have his despotism tempered by assassination than by
the mercy of a court of John Miltons.&nbsp; To which answer 
Milton would have rejoined, &lsquo;Despotism, I know you not, 
since we are as free as any people under heaven.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The weakest part in Milton&rsquo;s case is his having to admit
that the Parliament was overawed by the army, which he says was 
wiser than the senators.</p>
<p>Milton&rsquo;s address to his countrymen, with which he 
concludes the first defence, is veritably in his grand style:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;He has gloriously delivered you, the first 
of nations, from the two greatest mischiefs of this 
life&mdash;tyranny and superstition.&nbsp; He has endued you with
greatness of mind to be First of Mankind, who after having 
confined their own king and having had him delivered into their 
hands, have not scrupled to condemn <!-- page 33--><a 
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>him 
judicially, and pursuant to that sentence of condemnation to put 
him to death.&nbsp; After performing so glorious an action as 
this, you ought to do nothing that&rsquo;s mean and little; you 
ought not to think of, much less do, anything but what is great 
and sublime.&nbsp; Which to attain to, this is your only way: as 
you have subdued your enemies in the field, so to make it appear 
that you of all mankind are best able to subdue Ambition, 
Avarice, the love of Riches, and can best avoid the corruptions 
that prosperity is apt to introduce.&nbsp; These are the only 
arguments by which you will be able to evince that you are not 
such persons as this fellow represents you, traitors, robbers, 
murderers, parricides, madmen, that you did not put your king to 
death out of any ambitious design&mdash;that it was not an act of
fury or madness, but that it was wholly out of love to your 
liberty, your religion, to justice, virtue, and your country, 
that you punished a tyrant.&nbsp; But if it should fall out 
otherwise (which God forbid), if, as you have been valiant in 
war, you should grow debauched in peace, and that you should not 
have learnt, by so eminent, so remarkable an example before your 
eyes, to fear God, and <!-- page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>work righteousness; for my part I 
shall easily grant and confess (for I cannot deny it), whatever 
ill men may speak or think of you, to be very true.&nbsp; And you
will find in time that God&rsquo;s displeasure against you will 
be greater than it has been against your 
adversaries&mdash;greater than His grace and favour have been to 
yourseves, which you have had larger experience of than any other
nation under heaven.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This controversy naturally excited greater interest abroad, 
where Latin was familiarly known, than ever it did here at 
home.&nbsp; Though it cost Milton his sight, or at all events 
accelerated the hour of his blindness, he appears greatly to have
enjoyed conducting a high dispute in the face of Europe.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;I am,&rsquo; so he says, &lsquo;spreading abroad amongst 
the cities, the kingdoms, and nations, the restored culture of 
civility and freedom of life.&rsquo;&nbsp; We certainly managed 
in this affair of the execution of Charles to get rid of that 
note of insularity which renders our politics uninviting to the 
stranger.</p>
<p>Milton, despite his blindness, remained in the public service 
until after the death of Cromwell; in fact, he did not formally 
resign <!-- page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>until after the Restoration.&nbsp; He
played no part, having none to play, in the performances that 
occurred between those events.&nbsp; He poured forth pamphlets, 
but there is no reason to believe that they were read otherwise 
than carelessly and by few.&nbsp; His ideas were his own, and 
never had a chance of becoming fruitful.&nbsp; There seemed to 
him to be a ready and an easy way to establish a free 
Commonwealth, but on the whole it turned out that the easiest 
thing to do was to invite Charles Stuart to reascend the throne 
of his ancestors, which he did, and Milton went into hiding.</p>
<p>It is terrible to think how risky the situation was.&nbsp; 
Milton was undoubtedly in danger of his life, and <i>Paradise 
Lost</i> was unwritten.&nbsp; He was for a time under 
arrest.&nbsp; But after all he was not one of the 
regicides&mdash;he was only a scribe who had defended 
regicide.&nbsp; Neither was he a man well associated.&nbsp; He 
was a solitary, and, for the most part, an unpopular thinker, and
blind withal.&nbsp; He was left alone for the rest of his 
days.&nbsp; He lived first in Jewin Street, off Aldersgate 
Street; and finally in Artillery Walk, Bunhill Fields.&nbsp; He 
had married, four years after his first wife&rsquo;s death, a 
lady who died <!-- page 36--><a name="page36"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 36</span>within a twelvemonth, though her 
memory is kept ever fresh, generation after generation, by her 
husband&rsquo;s sonnet beginning,</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Methought I saw my late espoused 
saint.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr. Johnson, it is really worth remembering, called this a 
poor sonnet.&nbsp; In 1664 Milton married a third and last wife, 
a lady he had never seen, and who survived her husband for no 
less a period than fifty-three years, not dying till the year 
1727.&nbsp; The poet&rsquo;s household, like his country, never 
realized any of his ideals.&nbsp; His third wife took decent care
of him, and there the matter ended.&nbsp; He did not belong to 
the category of adored fathers.&nbsp; His daughters did not love 
him&mdash;it seems even probable they disliked him.&nbsp; Mr. 
Pattison has pointed out that Milton never was on terms even with
the scholars of his age.&nbsp; Political acquaintances he had 
none.&nbsp; He was, in Puritan language, &lsquo;unconnected with 
any place of worship,&rsquo; and had therefore no pastoral visits
to receive, or sermons to discuss.&nbsp; The few friends he had 
were mostly young men who were attracted to him, and were glad to
give him their company; and it is well that he had this pleasure,
for he was ever in his wishes a social man&mdash;not intended 
<!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
37</span>to live alone, and blindness must have made society 
little short of a necessity for him.</p>
<p>Now it was, in the evening of his days, with a Stuart once 
more upon the throne, and Episcopacy finally installed, that 
Milton, a defeated thinker, a baffled pamphleteer&mdash;for had 
not Salmasius triumphed?&mdash;with Horton and Italy far, far 
behind him, set himself to keep the promise of his glorious 
youth, and compose a poem the world should not willingly let 
die.&nbsp; His manner of life was this.&nbsp; In summer he rose 
at four, in winter at five.&nbsp; He went to bed at nine.&nbsp; 
He began the day with having the Hebrew Scriptures read to 
him.&nbsp; Then he contemplated.&nbsp; At seven his man came to 
him again, and he read and wrote till an early dinner.&nbsp; For 
exercise he either walked in the garden or swung in a 
machine.&nbsp; Besides conversation, his only other recreation 
was music.&nbsp; He played the organ and the bass viol.&nbsp; He 
would sometimes sing himself.&nbsp; After recreation of this kind
he would return to his study to be read to till six.&nbsp; After 
six his friends were admitted, and would sit with him till 
eight.&nbsp; At eight he had his supper&mdash;olives or something
light.&nbsp; He was very abstemious.&nbsp; After supper he smoked
a pipe of tobacco, drank a glass of <!-- page 38--><a 
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>water, and 
went to bed.&nbsp; He found the night a favourable time for 
composition, and what he composed at night he dictated in the 
day, sitting obliquely in an elbow chair with his leg thrown over
the arm.</p>
<p>In 1664 <i>Paradise Lost</i> was finished, but as in 1665 came
the Great Plague, and after the Great Plague the Great Fire, it 
was long before the MS. found its way into the hands of the 
licenser.&nbsp; It is interesting to note that the first member 
of the general public who read <i>Paradise Lost</i>, I hope all 
through, was a clergyman of the name of Tomkyns, the deputy of 
the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr. Sheldon.&nbsp; The Archbishop 
was the State Licenser for religious books, but of course did not
do the work himself.&nbsp; Tomkyns did the work, and was for a 
good while puzzled what to make of the old Republican&rsquo;s 
poem.&nbsp; At last, and after some singularly futile criticisms,
Tomkyns consented to allow the publication of <i>Paradise 
Lost</i>, which accordingly appeared in 1667, admirably printed, 
and at the price of 3<i>s.</i> a copy.&nbsp; The author&rsquo;s 
agreement with the publisher is in writing&mdash;as Mr. Besant 
tells us all agreements with publishers should be&mdash;and may 
be seen in the British Museum.&nbsp; Its terms are clear.&nbsp; 
The poet was to have &pound;5 down; <!-- page 39--><a 
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>another 
&pound;5 when the first edition, which was not to exceed 1,500 
copies, was sold; a third &pound;5 when a second edition was 
sold; and a fourth and last &pound;5 when a third edition was 
sold.&nbsp; He got his first &pound;5, also his second, and after
his death his widow sold all her rights for &pound;5.&nbsp; 
Consequently &pound;18, which represents perhaps &pound;50 of our
present currency, was Milton&rsquo;s share of all the money that 
has been made by the sale of his great poem.&nbsp; But the praise
is still his.&nbsp; The sale was very considerable.&nbsp; The 
&lsquo;general reader&rsquo; no doubt preferred the poems of 
Cleaveland and Flatman, but Milton found an audience which was 
fit and not fewer than ever is the case when noble poetry is 
first produced.</p>
<p><i>Paradise Regained</i> was begun upon the completion of 
<i>Paradise Lost</i>, and appeared with <i>Samson Agonistes</i> 
in 1671, and here ended Milton&rsquo;s life as a producing 
poet.&nbsp; He lived on till Sunday, 8th November, 1674, when the
gout, or what was then called gout, struck in and he died, and 
was buried beside his father in the Church of St. Giles&rsquo;s, 
Cripplegate.&nbsp; He remained laborious to the last, and imposed
upon himself all kinds of drudgery, compiling dictionaries, 
histories of Britain and Russia.&nbsp; He must have worked not so
much from love of <!-- page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>his subjects as from dread of 
idleness.&nbsp; But he had hours of relaxation, of social 
intercourse, and of music; and it is pleasant to remember that 
one pipe of tobacco.&nbsp; It consecrates your own.</p>
<p>Against Milton&rsquo;s great poem it is sometimes alleged that
it is not read; and yet it must, I think, be admitted that for 
one person who has read Spenser&rsquo;s <i>Fairy Queen</i>, ten 
thousand might easily be found who have read <i>Paradise 
Lost</i>.&nbsp; Its popularity has been widespread.&nbsp; Mr. 
Mark Pattison and Mr. John Bright measure some ground between 
them.&nbsp; No other poem can be mentioned which has so coloured 
English thought as Milton&rsquo;s, and yet, according to the 
French senator whom Mr. Arnold has introduced to the plain 
reader, &lsquo;<i>Paradise Lost</i> is a false poem, a grotesque 
poem, a tiresome poem.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is not easy for those who 
have a touch of Milton&rsquo;s temper, though none of his genius,
to listen to this foreign criticism quite coolly.&nbsp; Milton 
was very angry with Salmasius for venturing to find fault with 
the Long Parliament for having repealed so many laws, and so far 
forgot himself as to say, &lsquo;<i>Nam nostr&aelig; leges</i>, 
<i>Ole</i>, <i>quid ad te</i>?&rsquo;&nbsp; But there is nothing 
municipal about <i>Paradise Lost</i>.&nbsp; All the world has a 
<!-- page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
41</span>right to be interested in it and to find fault with 
it.&nbsp; But the fact that the people for whom primarily it was 
written have taken it to their hearts and have it on their lips 
ought to have prevented it being called tiresome by a senator of 
France.</p>
<p>But what is the matter with our great epic?&nbsp; That nobody 
ever wished it longer is no real accusation.&nbsp; Nobody ever 
did wish an epic longer.&nbsp; The most popular books in the 
world are generally accounted too long&mdash;<i>Don Quixote</i>, 
the <i>Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</i>, <i>Tom Jones</i>.&nbsp; But,
says Mr. Arnold, the whole real interest of the poem depends upon
our being able to take it literally; and again, &lsquo;Merely as 
matter of poetry, the story of the Fall has no special force or 
effectiveness&mdash;its effectiveness for us comes, and can only 
come, from our taking it all as the literal narrative of what 
positively happened.&rsquo;&nbsp; These bewildering utterances 
make one rub one&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp; Carlyle comes to our relief:
&lsquo;All which propositions I for the present content myself 
with modestly, but peremptorily and irrevocably 
denying.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Pattison surely speaks the language of ordinary good sense
when he writes: &lsquo;For the world of <i>Paradise Lost</i> is 
an ideal, conventional <!-- page 42--><a name="page42"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>world quite as much as the world of 
the <i>Arabian Nights</i>, or the world of the chivalrous 
romance, or that of the pastoral novel.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Coleridge, in the twenty-second chapter of the <i>Biographia 
Literaria</i>, points out that the fable and characters of 
<i>Paradise Lost</i> are not derived from Scripture, as in the 
<i>Messiah</i> of Klopstock, but merely suggested by it&mdash;the
illusion on which all poetry is founded being thus never 
contradicted.&nbsp; The poem proceeds upon a legend, ancient and 
fascinating, and to call it a commentary upon a few texts in 
Genesis is a marvellous criticism.</p>
<p>The story of the Fall of Man, as recorded in the Semitic 
legend, is to me more attractive as a story than the Tale of 
Troy, and I find the rebellion of Satan and his dire revenge more
to my mind than the circles of Dante.&nbsp; Eve is, I think, more
interesting than &lsquo;Heaven-born Helen, Sparta&rsquo;s 
queen&rsquo;&mdash;I mean in herself, and as a woman to write 
poetry about.</p>
<p>The execution of the poem is another matter.&nbsp; So far as 
style is concerned its merits have not yet been questioned.&nbsp;
As a matter of style and diction, Milton is as safe as 
Virgil.&nbsp; The handling of the story is more vulnerable.&nbsp;
The long speeches put in the mouth of the Almighty are <!-- page 
43--><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>never
pleasing, and seldom effective.&nbsp; The weak point about 
argument is that it usually admits of being answered.&nbsp; For 
Milton to essay to justify the ways of God to man was well and 
pious enough, but to represent God Himself as doing so by 
argumentative process was not so well, and was to expose the 
Almighty to possible rebuff.&nbsp; The king is always present in 
his own courts, but as judge, not as advocate; hence the royal 
dignity never suffers.</p>
<p>It is narrated of an eminent barrister, who became a most 
polished judge, Mr. Knight Bruce, that once, when at the very 
head of his profession, he was taken in before a Master in 
Chancery, an office since abolished, and found himself pitted 
against a little snip of an attorney&rsquo;s clerk, scarce higher
than the table, who, nothing daunted, and by the aid of 
authorities he cited from a bundle of books as big as himself, 
succeeded in worsting Knight Bruce, whom he persisted in calling 
over again and again &lsquo;my learned friend.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. 
Bruce treated the imp with that courtesy which is always an 
opponent&rsquo;s due, but he never went before the Masters any 
more.</p>
<p>The Archangel has not escaped the reproach often brought 
against affable persons of being a <!-- page 44--><a 
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>bit of a 
bore, and though this is to speak unbecomingly, it must be owned 
that the reader is glad whenever Adam plucks up heart of grace 
and gets in a word edgeways.&nbsp; Mr. Bagehot has complained of 
Milton&rsquo;s angels.&nbsp; He says they are silly.&nbsp; But 
this is, I think, to intellectualize too much.&nbsp; There are 
some classes who are fairly exempted from all obligation to be 
intelligent, and these airy messengers are surely amongst that 
number.&nbsp; The retinue of a prince or of a bride justify their
choice if they are well-looking and group nicely.</p>
<p>But these objections do not touch the main issue.&nbsp; Here 
is the story of the loss of Eden, told enchantingly, musically, 
and in the grand style.&nbsp; &lsquo;Who,&rsquo; says M. Scherer,
in a passage quoted by Mr. Arnold, &lsquo;can read the eleventh 
and twelfth books without yawning?&rsquo;&nbsp; People, of 
course, are free to yawn when they please, provided they put 
their hands to their mouths; but in answer to this insulting 
question one is glad to be able to remember how Coleridge has 
singled out Adam&rsquo;s vision of future events contained in 
these books as especially deserving of attention.&nbsp; But to 
read them is to repel the charge.</p>
<p>There was no need for Mr. Arnold, of <!-- page 45--><a 
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>all men, to 
express dissatisfaction with Milton:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Words which no ear ever to hear in 
heaven<br />
Expected; least of all from thee, ingrate,<br />
In place thyself so high above thy peers.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first thing for people to be taught is to enjoy great 
things greatly.&nbsp; The spots on the sun may be an interesting 
study, but anyhow the sun is not all spots.&nbsp; Indeed, 
sometimes in the early year, when he breaks forth afresh,</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;And winter, slumbering in the open air,<br 
/>
Wears on his smiling face a dream of spring,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>we are apt to forget that he has any spots at all, and, as he 
shines, are perhaps reminded of the blind poet sitting in his 
darkness, in this prosaic city of ours, swinging his leg over the
arm of his chair, and dictating the lines:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Seasons return, but not to me returns<br />
Day, or the sweet approach of even or morn,<br />
Or sight of vernal bloom or summer&rsquo;s rose,<br />
Or flocks or herds, or human face divine.<br />
But cloud instead, and ever-during dark<br />
Surrounds me&mdash;from the cheerful ways of men<br />
Cut off; and for the book of knowledge fair<br />
Presented with a universal blank<br />
Of nature&rsquo;s works, to me expunged and razed<br />
And wisdom at one entrance quite shut out.<br />
So much the rather, Thou, Celestial Light,<br />
<!-- page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
46</span>Shine inwards, and the mind through all her powers<br />
Irradiate&mdash;<i>there</i> plant eyes; all mist from thence<br 
/>
Purge and disperse, that I may see and tell<br />
Of things invisible to mortal sight.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Coleridge added a note to his beautiful poem, &lsquo;The 
Nightingale,&rsquo; lest he should be supposed capable of 
speaking with levity of a single line in Milton.&nbsp; The note 
was hardly necessary, but one loves the spirit that prompted him 
to make it.&nbsp; Sainte-Beuve remarks: &lsquo;Parler des 
po&egrave;tes est toujours une chose bien d&eacute;licate, et 
surtout quand on l&rsquo;a &eacute;t&eacute; un peu 
soi-m&ecirc;me.&rsquo;&nbsp; But though it does not matter what 
the little poets do, great ones should never pass one another 
without a royal salute.</p>
<h2><!-- page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
47</span>POPE.</h2>
<p><i>A Lecture delivered at Birmingham before the Midland 
Institute</i>.</p>
<p>The eighteenth century has been well abused by the 
nineteenth.&nbsp; So far as I can gather, it is the settled 
practice of every century to speak evil of her immediate 
predecessor, and I have small doubt that, had we gone groping 
about in the tenth century, we should yet have been found hinting
that the ninth was darker than she had any need to be.</p>
<p>But our tone of speaking about the last century has lately 
undergone an alteration.&nbsp; The fact is, we are drawing near 
our own latter end.&nbsp; The Head Master of Harrow lately 
thrilled an audience by informing them that he had, that very 
day, entered an existing <i>bon&acirc; fide</i> boy upon the 
school books, whose education, however, would not begin till the 
twentieth century.&nbsp; As a parent was overheard to observe, 
&lsquo;An illustration <!-- page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>of that sort comes home to 
one.&rsquo;&nbsp; The older we grow the less confident we become,
the readier to believe that our judgments are probably wrong, and
liable, and even likely, to be reversed; the better disposed to 
live and let live.&nbsp; The child, as Mr. Browning has somewhere
elaborated, cries for the moon and beats its nurse, but the old 
man sips his gruel with avidity and thanks Heaven if nobody beats
him.&nbsp; And so we have left off beating the eighteenth 
century.&nbsp; It was not so, however, in our lusty prime.&nbsp; 
Carlyle, historian though he was of Frederick the Great and the 
French Revolution, revenged himself for the trouble it gave him 
by loading it with all vile epithets.&nbsp; If it had been a cock
or a cook he could not have called it harder names.&nbsp; It was 
century spendthrift, fraudulent, bankrupt, a swindler century, 
which did but one true action, &lsquo;namely, to blow its brains 
out in that grand universal suicide named French 
Revolution.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The leaders of the neo-Catholic movement very properly 
shuddered at a century which whitewashed its churches and thought
even monthly communions affected.&nbsp; The ardent Liberal could 
not but despise a century which did without the franchise, and, 
despite the most <!-- page 49--><a name="page49"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>splendid materials, had no Financial 
Reform Almanack.&nbsp; The sentimental Tory found little to 
please him in the House of Hanover and Whig domination.&nbsp; The
lovers of poetry, with Shelley in their ears and Wordsworth at 
their hearts, made merry with the trim muses of Queen Anne, with 
their sham pastorals, their dilapidated classicism, and still 
more with their town-bred descriptions of the country, with its 
purling brooks and nodding groves, and, hanging over all, the 
moon&mdash;not Shelley&rsquo;s &lsquo;orbed maiden,&rsquo; but 
&lsquo;the refulgent lamp of night.&rsquo;&nbsp; And so, on all 
hands, the poor century was weighed in a hundred different 
balances and found wanting.&nbsp; It lacked inspiration, unction,
and generally all those things for which it was thought certain 
the twentieth century would commend us.&nbsp; But we do not talk 
like that now.&nbsp; The waters of the sullen Lethe, rolling 
doom, are sounding too loudly in our own ears.&nbsp; We would die
at peace with all centuries.&nbsp; Mr. Frederic Harrison writes a
formal <i>Defence of the Eighteenth Century</i>, Mr. Matthew 
Arnold reprints half a dozen of Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s <i>Lives of 
the Poets</i>.&nbsp; Mr. Leslie Stephen composes a history of 
thought during this objurgated period, and also edits, in 
sumptuously <!-- page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 50</span>inconvenient volumes, the works of 
its two great novelists, Richardson and Fielding; and, finally, 
there now trembles on the very verge of completion a splendid and
long-laboured edition of the poems and letters of the great poet 
of the eighteenth century, the abstract and brief chronicle of 
his time, a man who had some of its virtues and most of its 
vices, one whom it is easy to hate, but still easier to 
quote&mdash;Alexander Pope.</p>
<p>Twenty years ago the chances were that a lecturer on Pope 
began by asking the, perhaps not impertinent, question, 
&lsquo;Was he a poet?&rsquo;&nbsp; And the method had its merits,
for the question once asked, it was easy for the lecturer, like 
an incendiary who has just fired a haystack, to steal away amidst
the cracklings of a familiar controversy.&nbsp; It was not 
unfitting that so quarrelsome a man as Pope should have been the 
occasion of so much quarrelsomeness in others.&nbsp; For long the
battle waged as fiercely over Pope&rsquo;s poetry as erst it did 
in his own <i>Homer</i> over the body of the slain 
Patroclus.&nbsp; Stout men took part in it, notably Lord Byron, 
whose letters to Mr. Bowles on the subject, though composed in 
his lordship&rsquo;s most ruffianly vein, still make good 
reading&mdash;of a sort.&nbsp; But <!-- page 51--><a 
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>the battle is
over, at all events for the present.&nbsp; It is not now our 
humour to inquire too curiously about first causes or primal 
elements.&nbsp; As we are not prepared with a definition of 
poetry, we feel how impossible it would be for us to deny the 
rank of a poet to one whose lines not infrequently scan and 
almost always rhyme.&nbsp; For my part, I should as soon think of
asking whether a centipede has legs or a wasp a sting as whether 
the author of the <i>Rape of the Lock</i> and the <i>Epistle to 
Dr. Arbuthnot</i> was or was not a poet.</p>
<p>Pope&rsquo;s life has been described as a succession of petty 
secrets and third-rate problems, but there seems to be no doubt 
that it began on May 21st, 1688, in Lombard Street, in the city 
of London.&nbsp; But this event over, mystery steps in with the 
question, What was his father?&nbsp; The occupation of the elder 
Pope occasioned nearly as fierce a controversy as the poetical 
legitimacy of the younger.&nbsp; Malice has even hinted that old 
Pope was a hatter.&nbsp; The poet, of course, knew, but 
wouldn&rsquo;t tell, being always more ready, as Johnson 
observes, to say what his father was not than what he was.&nbsp; 
He denied the hatter, and said his father was of the family of 
the Earls of Downe; but on this <!-- page 52--><a 
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>statement 
being communicated to a relative of the poet, the brutal fellow, 
who was probably without a tincture of polite learning, said he 
heard of the relationship for the first time!&nbsp; &lsquo;Hard 
as thy heart, and as thy birth obscure,&rsquo; sang one of 
Pope&rsquo;s too numerous enemies in the easy numbers he had 
taught his age.&nbsp; It is, however, now taken as settled that 
the elder Pope, like Izaak Walton and John Gilpin, and many other
good fellows, was a linen-draper.&nbsp; He made money, and one 
would like to know how he did it in the troublesome times he 
lived in; but <i>his</i> books have all perished.&nbsp; He was a 
Roman Catholic, as also was the poet&rsquo;s mother, who was her 
husband&rsquo;s second wife, and came out of Yorkshire.&nbsp; It 
used to be confidently asserted that the elder Pope, on retiring 
from business, which he did early in the poet&rsquo;s childhood, 
put his fortune in a box and spent it as he needed it,&mdash;a 
course of conduct the real merits of which are likely to be hid 
from a lineal descendant.&nbsp; Old Pope, however, did nothing of
the kind, but invested money in the French funds, his conscience 
not allowing him to do so in the English, and he also lent sums 
on bond to fellow-Catholics, one of whom used to remit him his 
half-year&rsquo;s interest calculated at <!-- page 53--><a 
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>the rate of 
&pound;4 per cent. per annum, whereas by the terms of the bond he
was to pay &pound;4&frac14; per cent. per annum.&nbsp; On another
occasion the same borrower deducted from the interest accrued due
a pound he said he had lent the youthful poet.&nbsp; These things
annoyed the old gentleman, as they would most old gentlemen of my
acquaintance.&nbsp; The poet was the only child of his mother, 
and a queerly constituted mortal he was.&nbsp; Dr. Johnson has 
recorded the long list of his infirmities with an almost chilling
bluntness; but, alas! so malformed was Pope&rsquo;s character, so
tortuous and twisted were his ways, so elaborately artificial and
detestably petty many of his devices, that it is not malice, but 
charity, that bids us remember that, during his whole maturity, 
he could neither dress nor undress himself, go to bed or get up 
without help, and that on rising he had to be invested with a 
stiff canvas bodice and tightly laced, and have put on him a fur 
doublet and numerous stockings to keep off the cold and fill out 
his shrunken form.&nbsp; If ever there was a man whose life was 
one long provocation, that man was the author of the 
<i>Dunciad</i>.&nbsp; Pope had no means of self-defence save his 
wit.&nbsp; Dr. Johnson was a queer fellow enough, having 
inherited, as he <!-- page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>tells us, a vile melancholy from his 
father, and he certainly was no Adonis to look at, but those who 
laughed at him were careful to do so behind his gigantic 
back.&nbsp; When a rapacious bookseller insulted him he knocked 
him down.&nbsp; When the caricaturist Foote threatened to take 
him off upon the stage, the most Christian of lexicographers 
caused it to be intimated to him that if he did the author of 
<i>Rasselas</i> would thrash him in the public street, and the 
buffoon desisted.&nbsp; &lsquo;Did not Foote,&rsquo; asked 
Boswell, &lsquo;think of exhibiting you, sir?&rsquo; and our 
great moralist replied, &lsquo;Sir, fear restrained him; he knew 
I would have broken his bones.&rsquo;&nbsp; When he denounced 
Macpherson for his <i>Ossian</i> frauds, and the irate Celt said 
something about personal chastisement, Johnson told him, in 
writing, that he was not to be deterred from detecting a cheat by
the menaces of a ruffian, and by way of a temporary provision for
his self-defence selected a most grievous cudgel, six feet in 
height, and terminating in a head (once the root) of the size of 
a large orange.&nbsp; The possession of great physical strength 
is no mean assistance to a straightforward life.&nbsp; The late 
Professor Fawcett, who, though blind, delighted, arm-in-arm with 
a friend, to skate furiously on the fens, <!-- page 55--><a 
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>never could 
be brought to share the fears entertained on his behalf by some 
of the less stalwart of his acquaintances.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Why,&rsquo; he used to exclaim apologetically, &lsquo;even
if I do run up against anybody, it is always the other fellow who
gets the worst of it.&rsquo;&nbsp; But poor Pope, whom a child 
could hustle, had no such resources.&nbsp; We should always 
remember this; it is brutal to forget it.</p>
<p>Pope&rsquo;s parents found in their only son the vocation of 
their later life.&nbsp; He might be anything he liked.&nbsp; Did 
he lisp in numbers, the boyish rhymes were duly scanned and 
criticised; had he a turn for painting, lessons were 
provided.&nbsp; He might be anything he chose, and everything by 
turns.&nbsp; Many of us have been lately reading chapters from 
the life of another only son, and though the comparison may not 
bear working out, still, that there were points of strong 
similarity between the days of the youthful poet at Binfield and 
those of Ruskin at Herne Hill may be suspected.&nbsp; 
Pope&rsquo;s education was, of course, private, for a double 
reason&mdash;his proscribed faith and his frail form.&nbsp; Mr. 
Leslie Stephen, with a touching faith in public schools, has the 
hardihood to regret that it was obviously impossible to send Pope
to Westminster.&nbsp; <!-- page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>One shudders at the thought.&nbsp; It
could only have ended in an inquest.&nbsp; As it was, the poor 
little cripple was whipped at Twyford for lampooning his 
master.&nbsp; Pope was extraordinarily sensitive.&nbsp; Cruelty 
to animals he abhorred.&nbsp; Every kind of sport, from spinning 
cockchafers to coursing hares, he held in loathing, and one 
cannot but be thankful that the childhood of this supersensitive 
poet was shielded from the ruffianism of the nether world of boys
as that brood then existed.&nbsp; Westminster had not long to 
wait for Cowper.&nbsp; Pope was taught his rudiments by stray 
priests and at small seminaries, where, at all events, he had his
bent, and escaped the contagious error that Homer wrote in Greek 
in order that English boys might be beaten.&nbsp; Of course he 
did not become a scholar.&nbsp; Had he done so he probably would 
not have translated Homer, though he might have lectured on how 
not to do it.&nbsp; Indeed, the only evidence we have that Pope 
knew Greek at all is that he translated Homer, and was accustomed
to carry about with him a small pocket edition of the bard in the
original.&nbsp; Latin he could probably read with decent comfort,
though it is noticeable that if he had occasion to refer to a 
Latin book, and there was a <!-- page 57--><a 
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>French 
translation, he preferred the latter version to the 
original.&nbsp; Voltaire, who knew Pope, asserts that he could 
not speak a word of French, and could hardly read it; but 
Voltaire was not a truthful man, and on one occasion told lies in
an affidavit.&nbsp; The fact is, Pope&rsquo;s curiosity was too 
inordinate&mdash;his desire to know everything all at once too 
strong&mdash;to admit of the delay of learning a foreign 
language; and he was consequently a reader of translations, and 
he lived in an age of translations.&nbsp; He was, as a boy, a 
simply ferocious reader, and was early acquainted with the 
contents of the great poets, both of antiquity and the modern 
world.&nbsp; His studies, at once intense, prolonged, and 
exciting, injured his feeble health, and made him the lifelong 
sufferer he was.&nbsp; It was a noble zeal, and arose from the 
immense interest Pope ever took in human things.</p>
<p>From 1700 to 1715, that is, from his fourteenth to his 
twenty-ninth year, he lived with his father and mother at 
Binfield, on the borders of Windsor Forest, which he made the 
subject of one of his early poems, against which it was alleged, 
with surely some force, that it has nothing distinctive about it,
and might as easily have been written about any other forest; to 
<!-- page 58--><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
58</span>which, however, Dr. Johnson characteristically replied 
that the <i>onus</i> lay upon the critic of first proving that 
there is anything distinctive about Windsor Forest, which 
personally he doubted, one green field in the Doctor&rsquo;s 
opinion being just like another.&nbsp; In 1715 Pope moved with 
his parents to Chiswick, where, in 1717, his father, aged 
seventy-five, died.&nbsp; The following year the poet again moved
with his mother to the celebrated villa at Twickenham, where in 
1733 she died, in her ninety-third year.&nbsp; Ten years later 
Pope&rsquo;s long disease, his life, came to its appointed 
end.&nbsp; His poetical dates may be briefly summarized thus: his
<i>Pastorals</i>, 1709; the <i>Essay on Criticism</i>, 1711; the 
first version of the <i>Rape of the Lock</i>, 1712; the second, 
1714; the <i>Iliad</i>, begun in 1715, was finished 1720; 
<i>Eloisa</i>, 1717; the <i>Elegy</i> to the memory of an 
<i>Unfortunate Lady</i> and the <i>Dunciad</i>, 1728; the 
<i>Essay on Man</i>, 1732; and then the <i>Epistles</i> and 
<i>Satires</i>.&nbsp; Of all Pope&rsquo;s biographers, Dr. 
Johnson is still, and will probably ever remain, the best.&nbsp; 
The <i>Life</i>, indeed, like the rest of the <i>Lives of the 
Poets</i>, is a lazy performance.&nbsp; It is not the strenuous 
work of a young author eager for fame.&nbsp; When Johnson sat 
down, at the instance of the London <!-- page 59--><a 
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>booksellers, 
to write the lives of those poets whose works his employers 
thought it well to publish, he had long been an author at grass, 
and had no mind whatever again to wear the collar.&nbsp; He had 
great reading and an amazing memory, and those were at the 
service of the trade.&nbsp; The facts he knew, or which were 
brought to his door, he recorded, but research was not in his 
way.&nbsp; Was he not already endowed&mdash;with a pension, 
which, with his customary indifference to attack, he wished were 
twice as large, in order that his enemies might make twice as 
much fuss over it?&nbsp; None the less&mdash;nay, perhaps all the
more&mdash;for being written with so little effort, the <i>Lives 
of the Poets</i> are delightful reading, and Pope&rsquo;s is one 
of the very best of them. <a name="citation59"></a><a 
href="#footnote59" class="citation">[59]</a>&nbsp; None knew the 
infirmities of ordinary human nature better than Johnson.&nbsp; 
They neither angered him nor amused him; he neither storms, 
sneers, nor chuckles, as he records man&rsquo;s vanity, 
insincerity, jealousy, and pretence.&nbsp; It is with a placid 
pen he pricks <!-- page 60--><a name="page60"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 60</span>the bubble fame, dishonours the 
overdrawn sentiment, burlesques the sham philosophy of life; but 
for generosity, friendliness, affection, he is always on the 
watch, whilst talent and achievement never fail to win his 
admiration; he being ever eager to repay, as best he could, the 
debt of gratitude surely due to those who have taken pains to 
please, and who have left behind them in a world, which rarely 
treated them kindly, works fitted to stir youth to emulation, or 
solace the disappointments of age.&nbsp; And over all man&rsquo;s
manifold infirmities, he throws benignantly the mantle of his 
stately style.&nbsp; Pope&rsquo;s domestic virtues were not 
likely to miss Johnson&rsquo;s approbation.&nbsp; Of them he 
writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The filial piety of Pope was in the highest
degree amiable and exemplary.&nbsp; His parents had the happiness
of living till he was at the summit of poetical 
reputation&mdash;till he was at ease in his fortune, and without 
a rival in his fame, and found no diminution of his respect or 
tenderness.&nbsp; Whatever was his pride, to them he was 
obedient; and whatever was his irritability, to them he was 
gentle.&nbsp; Life has, amongst its soothing and quiet comforts, 
few things better to give than such a son.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
61</span>To attempt to state in other words a paragraph like this
would be indelicate, as bad as defacing a tombstone, or rewriting
a collect.</p>
<p>Pope has had many editors, but the last edition will probably 
long hold the field.&nbsp; It is more than sixty years since the 
original John Murray, of Albemarle Street, determined, with the 
approval of his most distinguished client Lord Byron, to bring 
out a library edition of Pope.&nbsp; The task was first entrusted
to Croker, the man whom Lord Macaulay hated more than he did cold
boiled veal, and whose edition, had it seen the light in the 
great historian&rsquo;s lifetime, would have been, whatever its 
merits, well basted in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>.&nbsp; But 
Croker seems to have made no real progress; for though 
occasionally advertised amongst Mr. Murray&rsquo;s list of 
forthcoming works, the first volume did not make its appearance 
until 1871, fourteen years after Croker&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; The 
new editor was the Rev. Whitwell Elwin, a clergyman, with many 
qualifications for the task,&mdash;patient, sensible, not too 
fluent, but an intense hater of Pope.&nbsp; &lsquo;To be wroth 
with one you love,&rsquo; sings Coleridge, &lsquo;doth work like 
madness in the brain;&rsquo; and to edit in numerous volumes the 
works of a man you cordially dislike <!-- page 62--><a 
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>and always 
mistrust has something of the same effect, whilst it is certainly
hard measure on the poor fellow edited.&nbsp; His lot&mdash;if I 
may venture upon a homely comparison founded upon a lively 
reminiscence of childhood&mdash;resembles that of an unfortunate 
infant being dressed by an angry nurse, in whose malicious hands 
the simplest operations of the toilet, to say nothing of the 
severer processes of the tub, can easily be made the vehicles of 
no mean torture.&nbsp; Good cause can be shown for hating Pope if
you are so minded, but it is something of a shame to hate him and
edit him too.&nbsp; The Rev. Mr. Elwin unravels the web of 
Pope&rsquo;s follies with too rough a hand for my liking; and he 
was, besides, far too apt to believe his poet in the wrong simply
because somebody has said he was.&nbsp; For example, he reprints 
without comment De Quincey&rsquo;s absurd strictures on the 
celebrated lines&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Who but must laugh if such a man there 
be;<br />
Who would not weep if Atticus were he!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>De Quincey found these lines unintelligible, and pulls them 
about in all directions but the right one.&nbsp; The ordinary 
reader never felt any difficulty.&nbsp; However, Mr. Elwin kept 
it up till old age overtook him, and now Mr. Courthope <!-- page 
63--><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
63</span>reigns in his stead.&nbsp; Mr. Courthope, it is easy to 
see, would have told a very different tale had he been in command
from the first, for he keeps sticking in a good word for the 
crafty little poet whenever he decently can.&nbsp; And this is 
how it should be.&nbsp; Mr. Courthope&rsquo;s <i>Life</i>, which 
will be the concluding volume of Mr. Murray&rsquo;s edition, is 
certain to be a fascinating book.</p>
<p>It is Pope&rsquo;s behaviour about his letters that is now 
found peculiarly repellent.&nbsp; Acts of diseased egotism 
sometimes excite an indignation which injurious crimes fail to 
arouse.</p>
<p>The whole story is too long to be told, and is by this time 
tolerably familiar.&nbsp; Here, however, is part of it.&nbsp; In 
early life Pope began writing letters, bits of pompous 
insincerity, as indeed the letters of clever boys generally are, 
to men old enough to be his grandparents, who had been struck by 
his precocity and anticipated his fame, and being always master 
of his own time, and passionately fond of composition, he kept up
the habit so formed, and wrote his letters as one might fancy the
celebrated Blair composing his sermons, with much solemnity, very
slowly, and without emotion.&nbsp; A packet of these addressed to
a gentleman owning the once proud name of Cromwell, and who was 
certainly <!-- page 64--><a name="page64"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 64</span>&lsquo;guiltless of his 
country&rsquo;s blood&rsquo;&mdash;for all that is now known of 
him is that he used to go hunting in a tie-wig, that is, a 
full-bottomed wig tied up at the ends&mdash;had been given by 
that gentleman to a lady with whom he had relations, who being, 
as will sometimes happen, a little pressed for money, sold them 
for ten guineas to Edmund Curll, a bold pirate of a bookseller 
and publisher, upon whose head every kind of abuse has been 
heaped, not only by the authors whom he actually pillaged, but by
succeeding generations of penmen who never took his wages, but 
none the less revile his name.&nbsp; He was a wily ruffian.&nbsp;
In the year 1727 he was condemned by His Majesty&rsquo;s judges 
to stand in the pillory at Charing Cross for publishing a libel, 
and thither doubtless, at the appointed hour, many poor authors 
flocked, with their pockets full of the bad eggs that should have
made their breakfasts, eager to wreak vengeance upon their 
employer; but a printer in the pillory has advantages over others
traders, and Curll had caused handbills to be struck off and 
distributed amongst the crowd, stating, with his usual 
effrontery, that he was put in the pillory for vindicating the 
blessed memory of her late Majesty Queen Anne.&nbsp; This either 
touched or tickled the mob&mdash;it does not <!-- page 65--><a 
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>matter 
which&mdash;who protected Curll whilst he stood on high from 
further outrage, and when his penance was over bore him on their 
shoulders to an adjacent tavern, where (it is alleged) he got 
right royally drunk. <a name="citation65"></a><a 
href="#footnote65" class="citation">[65]</a>&nbsp; Ten years 
earlier those pleasant youths, the Westminster scholars, had got 
hold of him, tossed him in a blanket, and beat him.&nbsp; This 
was the man who bought Pope&rsquo;s letters to Cromwell for ten 
guineas, and published them.&nbsp; Pope, oddly enough, though 
very angry, does not seem on this occasion to have moved the 
Court of Chancery, as he subsequently did against the same 
publisher, for an injunction to restrain the vending of the 
volume.&nbsp; Indeed, until his suit in 1741, when he obtained an
injunction against Curll, restraining the sale of a volume 
containing some of his letters to Swift, the right of the writer 
of a letter to forbid its publication had never been established,
and the view that a letter was a gift to the receiver had 
received some countenance.&nbsp; But Pope had so much of the true
temper of a litigant, and so loved a nice point, that he might 
have been expected to raise the question on the first 
opportunity.&nbsp; He, however, did not do so, and the volume had
a considerable sale&mdash;a fact not <!-- page 66--><a 
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>likely to be 
lost sight of by so keen an author as Pope, to whom the thought 
occurred, &lsquo;Could I only recover all my letters, and get 
them published, I should be as famous in prose as I am in 
rhyme.&rsquo;&nbsp; His communications with his friends now begin
to be full of the miscreant Curll, against whose machinations and
guineas no letters were proof.&nbsp; Have them Curll would, and 
publish them he would, to the sore injury of the writer&rsquo;s 
feelings.&nbsp; The only way to avoid this outrage upon the 
privacy of true friendship was for all the letters to be returned
to the writer, who had arranged for them to be received by a 
great nobleman, against whose strong boxes Curll might rage and 
surge in vain.&nbsp; Pope&rsquo;s friends did not at first quite 
catch his drift.&nbsp; &lsquo;You need give yourself no 
trouble,&rsquo; wrote Swift, though at a later date than the 
transaction I am now describing; &lsquo;every one of your letters
shall be burnt.&rsquo;&nbsp; But that was not what Pope 
wanted.&nbsp; The first letters he recovered were chiefly those 
he had written to Mr. Caryll, a Roman Catholic gentleman of 
character.&nbsp; Mr. Caryll parted with his letters with some 
reluctance, and even suspicion, and was at the extraordinary 
pains of causing them all to be transcribed; in a word, he kept 
copies <!-- page 67--><a name="page67"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 67</span>and said nothing about it.&nbsp; Now 
it is that Pope set about as paltry a job as ever engaged the 
attention of a man of genius.&nbsp; He proceeded to manufacture a
sham correspondence; he garbled and falsified to his 
heart&rsquo;s content.&nbsp; He took a bit of one letter and 
tagged it on to a bit of another letter, and out of these two 
foreign parts made up an imaginary letter, never really written 
to anybody, which he addressed to Mr. Addison, who was dead, or 
to whom else he chose.&nbsp; He did this without much regard to 
anything except the manufacture of something which he thought 
would read well, and exhibit himself in an amiable light and in a
sweet, unpremeditated strain.&nbsp; This done, the little poet 
destroyed the originals, and deposited one copy, as he said he 
was going to do, in the library of the Earl of Oxford, whose 
permission so to do he sought with much solemnity, the nobleman 
replying with curtness that any parcel Mr. Pope chose to send to 
his butler should be taken care of.&nbsp; So far good.&nbsp; The 
next thing was to get the letters published from the copy he had 
retained for his own use.&nbsp; His vanity and love of intrigue 
forbade him doing so directly, and he bethought himself of his 
enemy, the piratical Curll, with whom, there can now be no 
reasonable doubt, <!-- page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 68</span>he opened a sham correspondence under
the initials &lsquo;P.T.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;P.T.&rsquo; was made
to state that he had letters in his possession of Mr. 
Pope&rsquo;s, who had done him some disservice, which letters he 
was willing to let Curll publish.&nbsp; Curll was as wily as 
Pope, to whom he at once wrote and told him what 
&lsquo;P.T.&rsquo; was offering him.&nbsp; Pope replied by an 
advertisement in a newspaper, denying the existence of any such 
letters.&nbsp; &lsquo;P.T.,&rsquo; however, still kept it up, and
a mysterious person was introduced as a go-between, wearing a 
clergyman&rsquo;s wig and lawyer&rsquo;s bands.&nbsp; Curll at 
last advertised as forthcoming an edition of Mr. Pope&rsquo;s 
letters to, and, as the advertisement certainly ran, from divers 
noblemen and gentlemen.&nbsp; Pope affected the utmost fury, and 
set the House of Lords upon the printer for threatening to 
publish peers&rsquo; letters without their leave.&nbsp; Curll, 
however, had a tongue in his head, and easily satisfied a 
committee of their Lordship&rsquo;s House that this was a 
mistake, and that no noblemen&rsquo;s letters were included in 
the intended publication, the unbound sheets of which he 
produced.&nbsp; The House of Lords, somewhat mystified and 
disgusted, gave the matter up, and the letters came out in 
1735.&nbsp; Pope raved, but the judicious even then opined <!-- 
page 69--><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
69</span>that he protested somewhat too much.&nbsp; He promptly 
got a bookseller to pirate Curll&rsquo;s edition&mdash;a 
proceeding on his part which struck Curll as the unkindest cut of
all, and flagrantly dishonest.&nbsp; He took proceedings against 
Pope&rsquo;s publisher, but what came of the litigation I cannot 
say.</p>
<p>The Caryll copy of the correspondence as it actually existed, 
after long remaining in manuscript, has been published, and we 
have now the real letters and the sham letters side by 
side.&nbsp; The effect is grotesquely disgusting.&nbsp; For 
example, on September 20th, 1713, Pope undoubtedly wrote to 
Caryll as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I have been just taking a walk in St. 
James&rsquo;s Park, full of the reflections of the transitory 
nature of all human delights, and giving my thoughts a loose into
the contemplation of those sensations of satisfaction which 
probably we may taste in the more exalted company of separate 
spirits, when we range the starry walks above and gaze on the 
world at a vast distance, as now we do on those.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Poor stuff enough, one would have thought.&nbsp; On re-reading
this letter Pope was so pleased with his moonshine that he 
transferred the whole passage to an imaginary letter, to which 
<!-- page 70--><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
70</span>he gave the, of course fictitious, date of February 
10th, 1715, and addressed to Mr. Blount; so that, as the 
correspondence now stands, you first get the Caryll letter of 
1713, &lsquo;I have been just taking a solitary walk by 
moonshine,&rsquo; and so on about the starry walks; and then you 
get the Blount letter of 1715, &lsquo;I have been just taking a 
solitary walk by moonshine;&rsquo; and go on to find Pope 
refilled with his reflections as before.&nbsp; Mr. Elwin does 
not, you may be sure, fail to note how unlucky Pope was in his 
second date, February 10th, 1715; that being a famous year, when 
the Thames was frozen over, and as the thaw set in on the 9th, 
and the streets were impassable even for strong men, a tender 
morsel like Pope was hardly likely to be out after dark.&nbsp; 
But, of course, when Pope concocted the Blount letter in 1735, 
and gave it any date he chose, he could not be expected to carry 
in his head what sort of night it was on any particular day in 
February twenty-two years before.&nbsp; It is ever dangerous to 
tamper with written documents which have been out of your sole 
and exclusive possession even for a few minutes.</p>
<p>A letter Pope published as having been addressed to Addison is
made up of fragments <!-- page 71--><a name="page71"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>of three letters actually written to 
Caryll.&nbsp; Another imaginary letter to Addison contains the 
following not inapt passage from a letter to Caryll:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Good God! what an incongruous animal is 
man! how unsettled in his best part, his soul, and how changing 
and variable in his frame of body.&nbsp; What is man altogether 
but one mighty inconsistency?&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What, indeed!&nbsp; The method subsequently employed by Pope 
to recover his letters from Swift, and to get them published in 
such a way as to create the impression that Pope himself had no 
hand in it, cannot be here narrated.&nbsp; It is a story no one 
can take pleasure in.&nbsp; Of such an organized hypocrisy as 
this correspondence it is no man&rsquo;s duty to speak 
seriously.&nbsp; Here and there an amusing letter occurs, but as 
a whole it is neither interesting, elevating, nor amusing.&nbsp; 
When in 1741 Curll moved to dissolve the injunction Pope had 
obtained in connection with the Swift correspondence, his counsel
argued that letters on familiar subjects and containing inquiries
after the health of friends were not learned works, and 
consequently were not within the copyright statute of Queen Anne,
which was entitled, &lsquo;An Act for <!-- page 72--><a 
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>the 
Encouragement of Learning;&rsquo; but Lord Hardwicke, with his 
accustomed good sense, would have none of this objection, and 
observed (and these remarks, being necessary for the judgment, 
are not mere <i>obiter dicta</i>, but conclusive):</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;It is certain that no works have done more 
service to mankind than those which have appeared in this shape 
upon familiar subjects, and which, perhaps, were never intended 
to be published, and it is this which makes them so valuable, for
I must confess, for my own part, that letters which are very 
elaborately written, and originally intended for the press, are 
generally the most insignificant, and very little worth any 
person&rsquo;s reading&rsquo; (2 Atkyns, p. 357).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am encouraged by this authority to express the unorthodox 
opinion that Pope&rsquo;s letters, with scarcely half-a-dozen 
exceptions, and only one notable exception, are very little worth
any person&rsquo;s reading.</p>
<p>Pope&rsquo;s epistolary pranks have, perhaps, done him some 
injustice.&nbsp; It has always been the fashion to admire the 
letter which, first appearing in 1737, in Pope&rsquo;s 
correspondence, and there attributed to Gay, describes the death 
by <!-- page 73--><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
73</span>lightning of the rustic lovers John Hewet and Sarah 
Drew.&nbsp; An identical description occurring in a letter 
written by Pope to Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, and subsequently 
published by Warton from the original, naturally caused the poet 
to be accused of pilfering another man&rsquo;s letter, and 
sending it off as his own.&nbsp; Mr. Thackeray so puts it in his 
world-famous <i>Lectures</i>, and few literary anecdotes are 
better known; but the better opinion undoubtedly is that the 
letter was Pope&rsquo;s from the beginning, and attributed by him
to Gay because he did not want to have it appear that on the date
in question he was corresponding with Lady Mary.&nbsp; After all,
there is a great deal to be said in favour of honesty.</p>
<p>When we turn from the man to the poet we have at once to 
change our key.&nbsp; A cleverer fellow than Pope never commenced
author.&nbsp; He was in his own mundane way as determined to be a
poet, and the best going, as John Milton himself.&nbsp; He took 
pains to be splendid&mdash;he polished and pruned.&nbsp; His 
first draft never reached the printer&mdash;though he sometimes 
said it did.&nbsp; This ought, I think, to endear him to us in 
these hasty days, when authors high and low think nothing of 
emptying the slops of their <!-- page 74--><a 
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>minds over 
their readers, without so much as a cry of &lsquo;Heads 
below!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Pope&rsquo;s translation of the <i>Iliad</i> was his first 
great undertaking, and he worked at it like a Trojan.&nbsp; It 
was published by subscription for two guineas; that is, the first
part was.&nbsp; His friends were set to work to collect 
subscribers.&nbsp; Caryll alone got thirty-eight.&nbsp; Pope 
fully entered into this.&nbsp; He was always alive to the value 
of his wares, and despised the foppery of those of his literary 
friends who would not make money out of their books, but would do
so out of their country.&nbsp; He writes to Caryll:</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I am in good earnest of late, too much a man of 
business to mind metaphors and similes.&nbsp; I find subscribing 
much superior to writing, and there is a sort of little epigram I
more especially delight in, after the manner of rondeaus, which 
begin and end all in the same words, 
namely&mdash;&ldquo;Received&rdquo; and &ldquo;A. 
Pope.&rdquo;&nbsp; These epigrams end smartly, and each of them 
is tagged with two guineas.&nbsp; Of these, as I have learnt, you
have composed several ready for me to set my name to.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This is certainly much better than that trumpery walk in the 
moonshine.&nbsp; Pope had not at this time joined the Tories, and
both <!-- page 75--><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span>parties subscribed.&nbsp; He cleared over &pound;5,000 
by the <i>Iliad</i>.&nbsp; Over the <i>Odyssey</i> he slackened, 
and employed two inferior wits to do half the books; but even 
after paying his journeymen he made nearly &pound;4,000 over the 
<i>Odyssey</i>.&nbsp; Well might he write in later 
life&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Since, thanks to Homer, I do live and 
thrive.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pope was amongst the first of prosperous authors, and heads 
the clan of cunning fellows who have turned their lyrical cry 
into consols, and their odes into acres.</p>
<p>Of the merits of this great work it is not necessary to speak 
at length.&nbsp; Mr. Edmund Yates tells a pleasant story of how 
one day, when an old school Homer lay on his table, Shirley 
Brooks sauntered in, and taking the book up, laid it down again, 
dryly observing:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! I see you have <i>Homer&rsquo;s</i> Iliad!&nbsp; 
Well, I believe it is the best.&rsquo;&nbsp; And so it is.&nbsp; 
Homer&rsquo;s Iliad is the best, and Pope&rsquo;s Homer&rsquo;s 
Iliad is the second best.&nbsp; Whose is the third best is 
controversy.</p>
<p>Pope knew next to no Greek, but then he did not work upon the 
Greek text.&nbsp; He had Chapman&rsquo;s translation ever at his 
elbow, also the version of John Ogilby, which had appeared <!-- 
page 76--><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
76</span>in 1660&mdash;a splendid folio, with illustrations by 
the celebrated Hollar.&nbsp; Dryden had not got farther than the 
first book of the <i>Iliad</i>, and a fragment of the sixth 
book.&nbsp; A faithful rendering of the exact sense of Homer is 
not, of course, to be looked for.&nbsp; In the first book Pope 
describes the captive maid Briseis as looking back.&nbsp; In 
Homer she does not look back, but in Dryden she does; and Pope 
followed Dryden, and did not look, at all events, any farther 
back.</p>
<p>But what really is odd is that in Cowper&rsquo;s translation 
Briseis looks back too.&nbsp; Now, Cowper had been to a public 
school, and consequently knew Greek, and made it his special 
boast that, though dull, he was faithful.&nbsp; It is easy to 
make fun of Pope&rsquo;s version, but true scholars have seldom 
done so.&nbsp; Listen to Professor Conington <a 
name="citation76"></a><a href="#footnote76" 
class="citation">[76]</a>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;It has been, and I hope still is, the 
delight of every intelligent schoolboy.&nbsp; They read of kings,
and heroes, and mighty deeds in language which, in its calm 
majestic flow, unhasting, unresting, carries them on as 
irresistibly as Homer&rsquo;s own could do were they born readers
of Greek, and their minds <!-- page 77--><a 
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>are filled 
with a conception of the heroic age, not indeed strictly true, 
but almost as near the truth as that which was entertained by 
Virgil himself.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. D. G. Rossetti, himself both an admirable translator and a
distinguished poet, has in effect laid down the first law of 
rhythmical translation thus: &lsquo;Thou shalt not turn a good 
poem into a bad one.&rsquo;&nbsp; Pope kept this law.</p>
<p>Pope was a great adept at working upon other men&rsquo;s 
stuff.&nbsp; There is hardly anything in which men differ more 
enormously than in the degree in which they possess this faculty 
of utilization.&nbsp; Pope&rsquo;s <i>Essay on Criticism</i>, 
which brought him great fame, and was thought a miracle of wit, 
was the result of much hasty reading, undertaken with the 
intention of appropriation.&nbsp; Apart from the <i>lim&aelig; 
labor</i>, which was enormous, and was never grudged by Pope, 
there was not an hour&rsquo;s really hard work in it.&nbsp; 
Dryden had begun the work of English criticism with his <i>Essay 
on Dramatic Poesy</i>, and other well-known pieces.&nbsp; He had 
also translated Boileau&rsquo;s <i>Art of Poetry</i>.&nbsp; Then 
there were the works of those noble lords, Lord Sheffield, Lord 
Roscommon, Lord Granville, and the Duke of <!-- page 78--><a 
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
78</span>Buckingham.&nbsp; Pope, who loved a brief, read all 
these books greedily, and with an amazing quick eye for 
points.&nbsp; His orderly brain and brilliant wit re-arranged and
rendered resplendent the ill-placed and ill-set thoughts of other
men.</p>
<p>The same thing is noticeable in the most laboured production 
of his later life, the celebrated <i>Essay on Man</i>.&nbsp; For 
this he was coached by Lord Bolingbroke.</p>
<p>Pope was accustomed to talk with much solemnity of his ethical
system, of which the <i>Essay on Man</i> is but a fragment, but 
we need not trouble ourselves about it.&nbsp; Dr. Johnson said 
about <i>Clarissa Harlowe</i> that the man who read it for the 
story might hang himself; so we may say about the poetry of Pope:
the man who reads it for its critical or ethical philosophy may 
hang himself.&nbsp; We read Pope for pleasure, but a bit of his 
philosophy may be given:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Presumptuous man! the reason wouldst thou 
find,<br />
Why formed so weak, so little, and so blind?<br />
First, if thou canst, the harder reason guess,<br />
Why formed no weaker, blinder, and no less?<br />
Ask of thy mother Earth why oaks are made<br />
Taller and stronger than the weeds they shade!<br />
Or ask of yonder argent fields above<br />
Why Jove&rsquo;s satellites are less than Jove!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 79--><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
79</span>To this latter interrogatory presumptuous science, 
speaking through the mouth of Voltaire, was ready with an 
answer.&nbsp; If Jupiter were less than his satellites they 
wouldn&rsquo;t go round him.&nbsp; Pope can make no claim to be a
philosopher, and had he been one, Verse would have been a most 
improper vehicle to convey his speculations.&nbsp; No one 
willingly fights in handcuffs or wrestles to music.&nbsp; For a 
man with novel truths to promulgate, or grave moral laws to 
expound, to postpone doing so until he had hitched them into 
rhyme would be to insult his mission.&nbsp; Pope&rsquo;s gifts 
were his wit, his swift-working mind, added to all the cunning of
the craft and mystery of composition.&nbsp; He could say things 
better than other men, and hence it comes that, be he a great 
poet or a small one, he is a great writer, an English 
classic.&nbsp; What is it that constitutes a great writer?&nbsp; 
A bold question, certainly, but whenever anyone asks himself a 
question in public you may be certain he has provided himself 
with an answer.&nbsp; I find mine in the writings of a 
distinguished neighbour of yours, himself, though living, an 
English classic&mdash;Cardinal Newman.&nbsp; He says <a 
name="citation79"></a><a href="#footnote79" 
class="citation">[79]</a>:</p>
<p><!-- page 80--><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
80</span>&lsquo;I do not claim for a great author, as such, any 
great depth of thought, or breadth of view, or philosophy, or 
sagacity, or knowledge of human nature, or experience of human 
life&mdash;though these additional gifts he may have, and the 
more he has of them the greater he is,&mdash;but I ascribe to 
him, as his characteristic gift, in a large sense, the faculty of
expression.&nbsp; He is master of the two-fold 
&lambda;&omicron;y&omicron;&sigmaf;, the thought and the word, 
distinct but inseparable from each other. . . .&nbsp; He always 
has the right word for the right idea, and never a word too 
much.&nbsp; If he is brief it is because few words suffice; if he
is lavish of them, still each word has its mark, and aids, not 
embarrasses, the vigorous march of his elocution.&nbsp; He 
expresses what all feel, but all cannot say, and his sayings pass
into proverbs amongst his people, and his phrases become 
household words and idioms of their daily speech, which is 
tessellated with the rich fragments of his language, as we see in
foreign lands the marbles of Roman grandeur worked into the walls
and pavements of modern palaces.&rsquo;&nbsp; Pope satisfies this
definition.&nbsp; He has been dead one hundred and forty-two 
years; yet, next to Shakespeare, who has been dead two hundred 
and seventy years, and who was <!-- page 81--><a 
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>nearer to 
Pope than Pope is to us, he is the most quoted of English poets, 
the one who has most enriched our common speech.&nbsp; Horace 
used, but has long ceased, to be the poet of Parliament; for Mr. 
Gladstone, who, more than any other, has kept alive in Parliament
the scholarly traditions of the past, has never been very 
Horatian, preferring, whenever the dignity of the occasion seemed
to demand Latin, the long roll of the hexameter, something out of
Virgil or Lucretius.&nbsp; The new generation of honourable 
members might not unprofitably turn their attention to 
Pope.&nbsp; Think how, at all events, the labour members would 
applaud, not with &lsquo;a sad civility,&rsquo; but with 
downright cheers, a quotation they actually understood.</p>
<p>Pope is seen at his best in his satires and epistles, and in 
the mock-heroic.&nbsp; To say that the <i>Rape of the Lock</i> is
the best mock-heroic poem in the language is to say nothing; to 
say that it is the best in the world is to say more than my 
reading warrants; but to say that it and <i>Paradise Regained</i>
are the only two faultless poems, of any length, in English is to
say enough.</p>
<p>The satires are savage&mdash;perhaps satires should be; but 
Pope&rsquo;s satires are sometimes what satires <!-- page 82--><a
name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>should never 
be&mdash;shrill.&nbsp; Dr. Johnson is more to my mind as a sheer 
satirist than Pope, for in satire character tells more than in 
any other form of verse.&nbsp; We want a personality 
behind&mdash;a strong, gloomy, brooding personality; soured and 
savage if you will&mdash;nay, as soured and savage as you like, 
but spiteful never.</p>
<p>Pope became rather by the backing of his friends than from any
other cause a party man.&nbsp; Party feeling ran high during the 
first Georges, and embraced things now outside its 
ambit&mdash;the theatre, for example, and the opera.&nbsp; You 
remember how excited politicians got over Addison&rsquo;s 
<i>Cato</i>, which, as the work of a Whig, and appearing at a 
critical time, was thought to be full of a wicked wit and a 
subtle innuendo future ages have failed to discover amidst its 
obvious dulness.&nbsp; Pope, who was not then connected with 
either party, wrote the prologue, and in one of the best letters 
ever written to nobody tells the story of the first night.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The numerous and violent claps of the Whig 
party, on the one side the theatre, were echoed back by the 
Tories on the other, while the author sweated behind the scenes 
with concern to find their applause proceeded more from the hand 
than the head.&nbsp; This was the case <!-- page 83--><a 
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>too of the 
prologue-writer, who was clapped into a stanch Whig, sore against
his will, at almost every two lines.&nbsp; I believe that you 
have heard that, after all the applause of the opposite faction, 
my Lord Bolingbroke sent for Booth, who played Cato, into the box
between one of the acts, and presented him with fifty guineas, in
acknowledgment, as he expressed it, for his defending the cause 
of liberty so well against a perpetual dictator.&nbsp; The Whigs 
are unwilling to be distanced this way, as it is said, and, 
therefore, design a present to the said Cato very speedily.&nbsp;
In the meantime they are getting ready as good a sentence as the 
former on their side.&nbsp; So, betwixt them, it is probable that
Cato, as Dr. Garth expressed it, may have something to live upon 
after he dies.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later on music was dragged into the fray.&nbsp; The Court was 
all for Handel and the Germans; the Prince of Wales and the Tory 
nobility affected the Italian opera.&nbsp; The Whigs went to the 
Haymarket; the Tories to the Opera House in Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn 
Field.&nbsp; In this latter strife Pope took small part; for, 
notwithstanding his <i>Ode on St. Cecilia&rsquo;s Day</i>, he 
hated music with an entire sincerity.&nbsp; He also affected to 
<!-- page 84--><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
84</span>hate the drama; but some have thought this accounted for
by the fact that, early in his career, he was damned for the 
farce of <i>Three Hours after Marriage</i>, which, after the 
fashion of our own days, he concocted with another, the co-author
in this case being a wit of no less calibre than Gay, the author 
of <i>The Beggars&rsquo; Opera</i>.&nbsp; The astonished audience
bore it as best they might till the last act, when the two 
lovers, having first inserted themselves respectively into the 
skins of a mummy and a crocodile, talk at one another across the 
boards; then they rose in their rage, and made an end of that 
farce.&nbsp; Their yells were doubtless still in Pope&rsquo;s 
ears when, years afterwards, he wrote the fine lines&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;While all its throats the gallery 
extends<br />
And all the thunder of the pit ascends,<br />
Loud as the wolves on Orca&rsquo;s stormy steep<br />
Howl to the roarings of the northern deep.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pope, as we have said, became a partisan, and so had his hands
full of ready-made quarrels; but his period was certainly one 
that demanded a satirist.&nbsp; Perhaps most periods do; but I am
content to repeat, his did.&nbsp; Satire like Pope&rsquo;s is 
essentially modish, and requires a restricted range.&nbsp; Were 
anyone desirous of satirizing <!-- page 85--><a 
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>humanity at 
large I should advise him to check his noble rage, and, at all 
events, to begin with his next-door neighbour, who is almost 
certain to resent it, which humanity will not do.&nbsp; This was 
Pope&rsquo;s method.&nbsp; It was a corrupt set amongst whom he 
moved.&nbsp; The gambling in the South Sea stock had been 
prodigious, and high and low, married and single, town and 
country, Protestant and Catholic, Whig and Tory, took part in 
it.&nbsp; One <i>could</i> gamble in that stock.&nbsp; The mania 
began in February 1720, and by the end of May the price of 
&pound;100 stock was up to &pound;340.&nbsp; In July and August 
it was &pound;950, and even touched, &pound;1,000.&nbsp; In the 
middle of September it was down to &pound;590, and before the end
of the year it had dropped to &pound;125.&nbsp; Pope himself 
bought stock when it stood so low as &pound;104, but he had never
the courage to sell, and consequently lost, according to his own 
account, half his worldly possessions.&nbsp; The Prime Minister, 
Sir Robert Walpole, also bought stock, but he sold&mdash;as did 
his Most Gracious Majesty the King&mdash;at &pound;1,000.&nbsp; 
The age was also a scandalous, ill-living age, and Pope, who was 
a most confirmed gossip and tale-bearer, picked up all that was 
going.&nbsp; The details of every lawsuit of a personal <!-- page
86--><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
86</span>character were at his finger-ends.&nbsp; Whoever starved
a sister, or forged a will, or saved his candle-ends, made a 
fortune dishonestly, or lost one disgracefully, or was reported 
to do so, be he citizen or courtier, noble duke or plump 
alderman, Mr. Pope was sure to know all about it, and as likely 
as not to put it into his next satire.&nbsp; Living, as the poet 
did, within easy distance of London, he always turned up in a 
crisis as regularly as a porpoise in a storm, so at least writes 
a noble friend.&nbsp; This sort of thing naturally led to 
quarrels, and the shocking incompleteness of this lecture stands 
demonstrated by the fact that, though I have almost done, I have 
as yet said nothing abort Pope&rsquo;s quarrels, which is nearly 
as bad as writing about St. Paul and leaving out his 
journeys.&nbsp; Pope&rsquo;s quarrels are celebrated.&nbsp; His 
quarrel with Mr. Addison, culminating in the celebrated 
description, almost every line of which is now part and parcel of
the English language; his quarrel with Lady Mary Wortley Montagu,
whom he satirized in the most brutal lines ever written by man of
woman; his quarrel with Lord Hervey; his quarrel with the 
celebrated Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough, ought not to be 
dismissed so lightly, but what can I do?&nbsp; From the Duchess 
of <!-- page 87--><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
87</span>Marlborough Pope is said to have received a sum of 
money, sometimes stated at &pound;1,000 and sometimes at 
&pound;3,000, for consenting to suppress his description of her 
as Atossa, which, none the less, he published.&nbsp; I do not 
believe the story; money passed between the parties and went to 
Miss Martha Blount, but it must have been for some other 
consideration.&nbsp; Sarah Jennings was no fool, and loved money 
far too well to give it away without security; and how possibly 
could she hope by a cash payment to erase from the tablets of a 
poet&rsquo;s memory lines dictated by his hate, or bind by the 
law of honour a man capable of extorting blackmail?&nbsp; Then 
Pope quarrelled most terribly with the elder Miss Blount, who, he
said, used to beat her mother; then he quarrelled with the mother
because she persisted in living with the daughter and pretending 
to be fond of her.&nbsp; As for his quarrels with the whole tribe
of poor authors, are they not writ large in the four books of the
<i>Dunciad</i>?&nbsp; Mr. Swinburne is indeed able to find in 
some, at all events, of these quarrels a species of holy war, 
waged, as he says, in language which is at all events strong, 
&lsquo;against all the banded bestialities of all dunces and all 
dastards, all blackguardly blockheads and all blockheaded 
blackguards.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 88--><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
88</span>I am sorry to be unable to allow myself to be wound up 
in Mr. Swinburne&rsquo;s bucket to the height of his 
argument.&nbsp; There are two kinds of quarrels, the noble and 
the ignoble.&nbsp; When John Milton, weary and depressed for a 
moment in the battle he was fighting in the cause of an 
enlightened liberty and an instructed freedom, exclaims, with the
sad prophet Jeremy, &lsquo;Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast 
borne me, a man of strife and contention,&rsquo; we feel the 
sublimity of the quotation, which would not be quite the case 
were the words uttered by an Irishman returning home with a 
broken head from Donnybrook Fair.&nbsp; The <i>Dunciad</i> was 
quite uncalled-for.&nbsp; Even supposing that we admit that Pope 
was not the aggressor:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;The noblest answer unto 
such<br />
Is kindly silence when they brawl.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But it is, to say the least of it, doubtful whether Pope did 
not begin brawling first.&nbsp; Swift, whose misanthropy was 
genuine, and who begged Pope whenever he thought of the world to 
give it another lash on his (the Dean&rsquo;s) account, saw 
clearly the danger of Pope&rsquo;s method, and wrote to him: 
&lsquo;Take care the bad poets do not out-wit you as they have 
done the good ones in <!-- page 89--><a name="page89"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 89</span>every age; whom they have provoked to
transmit their names to posterity.&nbsp; M&aelig;vius is as well 
known as Virgil, and Gildon will be as well known as you if his 
name gets into your verses; and as for the difference between 
good and bad fame, it is a mere trifle.&rsquo;&nbsp; The advice 
was far too good to be taken.&nbsp; But what has happened?&nbsp; 
The petty would-be Popes, but for the real Pope, would have been 
entirely forgotten.&nbsp; As it is, only their names survive in 
the index to the <i>Dunciad</i>; their indecencies and dastardly 
blockheadisms are as dead as Queen Anne; and if the historian or 
the moralist seeks an illustration of the coarseness and 
brutality of their style, he finds it only too easily, not in the
works of the dead dunces, but in the pages of their 
persecutor.&nbsp; Pope had none of the grave purpose which makes 
us, at all events, partially sympathize with Ben Jonson in his 
quarrels with the poetasters of his day.&nbsp; It is a mere 
toss-up whose name you may find in the <i>Dunciad</i>&mdash;a 
miserable scribbler&rsquo;s or a resplendent scholar&rsquo;s; a 
tasteless critic&rsquo;s or an immortal wit&rsquo;s.&nbsp; A 
satirist who places Richard Bentley and Daniel Defoe amongst the 
Dunces must be content to abate his pretensions to be regarded as
a social purge.</p>
<p><!-- page 90--><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
90</span>Men and women, we can well believe, went in terror of 
little Mr. Pope.&nbsp; Well they might, for he made small 
concealment of their names, and even such as had the luck to 
escape obvious recognition have been hoisted into infamy by the 
untiring labours of subsequent commentators.&nbsp; It may, 
perhaps, be still open to doubt who was the Florid Youth referred
to in the Epilogue to the <i>Satires</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;And how did, pray, the Florid Youth 
offend<br />
Whose speech you took and gave it to a friend?&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bowles said it was Lord Hervey, and that the adjective is due 
to his lordship&rsquo;s well-known practice of painting himself; 
but Mr. Croker, who knew everything, and was in the habit of 
contradicting the Duke of Wellington about the battle of 
Waterloo, says, &lsquo;Certainly not.&nbsp; The Florid Youth was 
young Henry Fox.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sometimes, indeed, in our hours of languor and dejection, 
when</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;The heart is sick,<br />
And all the wheels of being slow,&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the question forces itself upon us, What can it matter who the
Florid Youth was, and who cares how he offended?&nbsp; But this 
questioning <!-- page 91--><a name="page91"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 91</span>spirit must be checked.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;The proper study of mankind is man,&rsquo; and that title 
cannot be denied even to a florid youth.&nbsp; Still, as I was 
saying, people did not like it at the time, and the then Duke of 
Argyll said, in his place in the House of Lords, that if anybody 
so much as named him in an invective, he would first run him 
through the body, and then throw himself&mdash;not out of the 
window, as one was charitably hoping&mdash;but on a much softer 
place&mdash;the consideration of their Lordship&rsquo;s 
House.&nbsp; Some persons of quality, of less truculent aspect 
than McCallum More, thought to enlist the poet&rsquo;s services, 
and the Duchess of Buckingham got him to write an epitaph on her 
deceased son&mdash;a feeble lad&mdash;to which transaction the 
poet is thought to allude in the pleasing lines,</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;But random praise&mdash;the task can 
ne&rsquo;er be done,<br />
Each mother asks it for her booby son.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Alderman Barber asked it for himself, and was 
willing&mdash;so at least it was reported&mdash;to pay for it at 
the handsome figure of &pound;4,000 for a single couplet.&nbsp; 
Pope, however, who was not mercenary, declined to gratify the 
alderman, who by his will left the poet a legacy of &pound;100, 
possibly hoping by this benefaction, if he could <!-- page 
92--><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>not 
be praised in his lifetime, at all events to escape posthumous 
abuse.&nbsp; If this were his wish it was gratified, and the 
alderman sleeps unsung.</p>
<p>Pope greatly enjoyed the fear he excited.&nbsp; With something
of exultation he sings:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Yes, I am proud: I must be proud to see<br 
/>
Men, not afraid of God, afraid of me;<br />
Safe from the bar, the pulpit, and the throne,<br />
Yet touched and shamed by ridicule alone.<br />
O sacred weapon! left for Truth&rsquo;s defence,<br />
Sole dread of folly, vice, and insolence!<br />
To all but heaven-directed hands denied,<br />
The Muse may give thee, but the gods must guide:<br />
Reverent I touch thee, but with honest zeal,<br />
To rouse the watchmen of the public weal,<br />
To Virtue&rsquo;s work provoke the tardy Hall<br />
And goad the prelate slumb&rsquo;ring in his stall.<br />
Ye tinsel insects! whom a court maintains,<br />
That counts your beauties only by your stains,<br />
Spin all your cobwebs o&rsquo;er the eye of day,<br />
The Muse&rsquo;s wing shall brush you all away.<br />
All his grace preaches, all his lordship sings,<br />
All that makes saints of queens, and gods of kings,&mdash;<br />
All, all but truth drops dead-born from the press,<br />
Like the last gazette, or the last address.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The poet himself was very far from being invulnerable, and he 
writhed at every sarcasm.&nbsp; There was one of his 
contemporaries of whom <!-- page 93--><a name="page93"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 93</span>he stood in mortal dread, but whose 
name he was too frightened even to mention.&nbsp; It is easy to 
guess who this was.&nbsp; It was Hogarth, who in one of his 
caricatures had depicted Pope as a hunchback, whitewashing 
Burlington House.&nbsp; Pope deemed this the most grievous insult
of his life, but he said nothing about it; the spiteful pencil 
proving more than master of the poisoned pen.</p>
<p>Pope died on May 30th, 1744, bravely and cheerfully 
enough.&nbsp; His doctor was offering him one day the usual 
encouragements, telling him his breath was easier, and so on, 
when a friend entered, to whom the poet exclaimed, &lsquo;Here I 
am, dying of a hundred good symptoms.&rsquo;&nbsp; In 
Spence&rsquo;s <i>Anecdotes</i> there is another story, pitched 
in a higher key: &lsquo;Shortly before his death, he said to me, 
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; pointing into the air with a 
very steady regard, and then looked down on me and said, with a 
smile of great pleasure, and with the greatest softness, 
&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas a vision.&rdquo;&rsquo;&nbsp; It may have been
so.&nbsp; At the very last he consented to allow a priest to be 
sent for, who attended and administered to the dying man the last
sacraments of the Church.&nbsp; The spirit in which he received 
them cannot be pronounced religious.&nbsp; As Cardinal Newman 
<!-- page 94--><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
94</span>has observed, Pope was an unsatisfactory Catholic.</p>
<p>Pope died in his enemies&rsquo; day.</p>
<p>Dr. Arbuthnot, who was acknowledged by all his friends to have
been the best man who ever lived, be the second-best who he 
might, had predeceased the poet; and it should be remembered, 
before we take upon ourselves the task of judging a man we never 
saw, that Dr. Arbuthnot, who was as shrewd as he was good, had 
for Pope that warm personal affection we too rarely notice 
nowadays between men of mature years.&nbsp; Swift said of 
Arbuthnot: &lsquo;Oh! if the world had but a dozen Arbuthnots in 
it I would burn my <i>Travels</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; This may be 
doubted without damage to the friendly testimony.&nbsp; The 
terrible Dean himself, whose azure eyes saw through most 
pretences, loved Pope; but Swift was now worse than dead&mdash;he
was mad, dying a-top, like the shivered tree he once gazed upon 
with horror and gloomy forebodings of impending doom.</p>
<p>Many men must have been glad when they read in their scanty 
journals that Mr. Pope lay dead at his villa in Twickenham.&nbsp;
They breathed the easier for the news.&nbsp; Personal satire may 
be a legitimate, but it is an ugly weapon.&nbsp; The Muse often 
gives what the gods do not guide; <!-- page 95--><a 
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>and though we
may be willing that our faults should be scourged, we naturally 
like to be sure that we owe our sore backs to the blackness of 
our guilt, and not merely to the fact that we have the proper 
number of syllables to our names, or because we occasionally dine
with an enemy of our scourger.</p>
<p>But living as we do at a convenient distance from Mr. Pope, we
may safely wish his days had been prolonged, not necessarily to 
those of his mother, but to the Psalmist&rsquo;s span, so that he
might have witnessed the dawn of a brighter day.&nbsp; 1744 was 
the nadir of the eighteenth century.&nbsp; With Macbeth the dying
Pope might have exclaimed,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Renown and grace is 
dead;<br />
The wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees<br />
Is left in the vault to brag of.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The feats of arms that have made the first Ministry of the 
elder Pitt for ever glorious would have appealed to Pope&rsquo;s 
better nature, and made him forget the scandals of the court and 
the follies of the town.&nbsp; Who knows but they might have 
stirred him, for he was not wholly without the true poet&rsquo;s 
prophetic gift, which dreams of things to come, to foretell, in 
that animated and <!-- page 96--><a name="page96"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 96</span>animating style of his, which has no 
rival save glorious John Dryden&rsquo;s, the expansion of 
England, and how, in far-off summers he should never see, English
maidens, living under the Southern Cross, should solace their 
fluttering hearts before laying themselves down to sleep with 
some favourite bit from his own <i>Eloisa to Abelard</i>?&nbsp; 
Whether, in fact, maidens in those latitudes do read 
<i>Eloisa</i> before blowing out their candles I cannot say; but 
Pope, I warrant, would have thought they would.&nbsp; And they 
might do worse&mdash;and better.</p>
<p>Both as a poet and a man Pope had many negations.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Of love, that sways the sun and all the 
stars,&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>he knew absolutely nothing.&nbsp; Even of the lesser 
light,</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;The eternal moon of 
love,<br />
Under whose motions life&rsquo;s dull billows move,&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>he knew but little.</p>
<p>His <i>Eloisa</i>, splendid as is its diction, and vigorous 
though be the portrayal of the miserable creature to whom the 
poem relates, most certainly lacks &lsquo;a gracious 
somewhat,&rsquo; whilst no less certainly is it marred by a most 
unfeeling coarseness.&nbsp; A poem about love it may be&mdash;a 
<!-- page 97--><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
97</span>love-poem it is not.&nbsp; Of the &lsquo;wild benefit of
nature,&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The silence that is in the starry sky,<br 
/>
The sleep that is among the lonely hills,&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pope had small notion, though there is just a whiff of 
Wordsworth in an observation he once hazarded, that a tree is a 
more poetical object than a prince in his coronation robes.&nbsp;
His taste in landscape gardening was honoured with the 
approbation of Horace Walpole, and he spent &pound;1,000 upon a 
grotto, which incurred the ridicule of Johnson.&nbsp; Of that 
indescribable something, that &lsquo;greatness&rsquo; which 
causes Dryden to uplift a lofty head from the deep pit of his 
corruption, neither Pope&rsquo;s character nor his style bears 
any trace.&nbsp; But still, both as a poet and a man we must give
place, and even high place, to Pope.&nbsp; About the poetry there
can be no question.&nbsp; A man with his wit, and faculty of 
expression, and infinite painstaking, is not to be evicted from 
his ancient homestead in the affections and memories of his 
people by a rabble of critics, or even a <i>posse</i> of 
poets.&nbsp; As for the man, he was ever eager and interested in 
life.&nbsp; Beneath all his faults&mdash;for which he had more 
excuse than a whole congregation of the righteous need ever <!-- 
page 98--><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
98</span>hope to muster for their own shortcomings&mdash;we 
recognise humanity, and we forgive much to humanity, knowing how 
much need there is for humanity to forgive us.&nbsp; 
Indifference, known by its hard heart and its callous temper, is 
the only unpardonable sin.&nbsp; Pope never committed it.&nbsp; 
He had much to put up with.&nbsp; We have much to put up 
with&mdash;in him.&nbsp; He has given enormous pleasure to 
generations of men, and will continue so to do.&nbsp; We can 
never give him any pleasure.&nbsp; The least we can do is to 
smile pleasantly as we replace him upon his shelf, and say, as we
truthfully may, &lsquo;There was a great deal of human nature in 
Alexander Pope.&rsquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 99--><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
99</span>DR. JOHNSON.</h2>
<p>If we should ever take occasion to say of Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s 
Preface to Shakspeare what he himself said of a similar 
production of the poet Rowe, &lsquo;that it does not discover 
much profundity or penetration,&rsquo; we ought in common 
fairness always to add that nobody else has ever written about 
Shakspeare one-half so entertainingly.&nbsp; If this statement be
questioned, let the doubter, before reviling me, re-read the 
preface, and if, after he has done so, he still demurs, we shall 
be content to withdraw the observation, which, indeed, has only 
been made for the purpose of introducing a quotation from the 
Preface itself.</p>
<p>In that document, Dr. Johnson, with his unrivalled 
stateliness, writes as follows:&mdash;&lsquo;The poet of whose 
works I have undertaken the revision may now begin to assume the 
dignity of an ancient, and claim the privilege of established 
fame and prescriptive veneration.&nbsp; <!-- page 100--><a 
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>He has long
outlived his century, the term commonly fixed as the test of 
literary merit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The whirligig of time has brought in his revenges.&nbsp; The 
Doctor himself has been dead his century.&nbsp; He died on the 
13th of December, 1784.&nbsp; Come, let us criticise him.</p>
<p>Our qualifications for this high office need not be 
investigated curiously.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Criticism,&rsquo; writes Johnson in the 60th 
<i>Idler</i>, &lsquo;is a study by which men grow important and 
formidable at a very small expense.&nbsp; The power of invention 
has been conferred by nature upon few, and the labour of learning
those sciences which may by mere labour be obtained, is too great
to be willingly endured; but every man can exert such judgment as
he has upon the works of others; and he whom nature has made 
weak, and idleness keeps ignorant, may yet support his vanity by 
the name of a critick.&rsquo;</p>
<p>To proceed with our task by the method of comparison is to 
pursue a course open to grave objection, yet it is forced upon us
when we find, as we lately did, a writer in the <i>Times</i> 
newspaper, in the course of a not very discriminating review of 
Mr. Froude&rsquo;s recent volumes, casually remarking, as if it 
admitted of no more doubt than the day&rsquo;s price of consols, 
that Carlyle was <!-- page 101--><a name="page101"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 101</span>a greater man than Johnson.&nbsp; It
is a good thing to be positive.&nbsp; To be positive in your 
opinions and selfish in your habits is the best recipe, if not 
for happiness, at all events for that far more attainable 
commodity, comfort, with which we are acquainted.&nbsp; &lsquo;A 
noisy man,&rsquo; sang poor Cowper, who could not bear anything 
louder than the hissing of a tea-urn, &lsquo;a noisy man is 
always in the right,&rsquo; and a positive man can seldom be 
proved wrong.&nbsp; Still, in literature it is very desirable to 
preserve a moderate measure of independence, and we, therefore, 
make bold to ask whether it is as plain as the &lsquo;old hill of
Howth,&rsquo; that Carlyle was a greater man than Johnson?&nbsp; 
Is not the precise contrary the truth?&nbsp; No abuse of Carlyle 
need be looked for here or from me.&nbsp; When a man of genius 
and of letters happens to have any striking virtues, such as 
purity, temperance, honesty, the novel task of dwelling on them 
has such attraction for us, that we are content to leave the 
elucidation of his faults to his personal friends, and to stern, 
unbending moralists like Mr. Edmund Yates and the <i>World</i> 
newspaper. <a name="citation101"></a><a href="#footnote101" 
class="citation">[101]</a>&nbsp; To love Carlyle is, thanks to 
Mr. Froude&rsquo;s super-human <!-- page 102--><a 
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>ideal of 
friendship, a task of much heroism, almost meriting a pension; 
still, it is quite possible for the candid and truth-loving 
soul.&nbsp; But a greater than Johnson he most certainly was 
not.</p>
<p>There is a story in Lockhart&rsquo;s <i>Life of Scott</i> of 
an ancient beggar-woman, who, whilst asking an alms of Sir 
Walter, described herself, in a lucky moment for her pocket, as 
&lsquo;an old struggler.&rsquo;&nbsp; Scott made a note of the 
phrase in his diary, and thought it deserved to become 
classical.&nbsp; It certainly clings most tenaciously to the 
memory&mdash;so picturesquely does it body forth the striving 
attitude of poor battered humanity.&nbsp; Johnson was &lsquo;an 
old struggler.&rsquo; <a name="citation102"></a><a 
href="#footnote102" class="citation">[102]</a>&nbsp; So too, in 
all conscience, was Carlyle.&nbsp; The struggles of Johnson have 
long been historical; those of Carlyle have just become so.&nbsp;
We are interested in both.&nbsp; To be indifferent would be 
inhuman.&nbsp; Both men had great endowments, tempestuous 
natures, hard lots.&nbsp; They were not amongst Dame 
Fortune&rsquo;s favourites.&nbsp; They had to fight their 
way.&nbsp; What they took they took by storm.&nbsp; <!-- page 
103--><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
103</span>But&mdash;and here is a difference indeed&mdash;Johnson
came off victorious, Carlyle did not.</p>
<p>Boswell&rsquo;s book is an arch of triumph, through which, as 
we read, we see his hero passing into eternal fame, to take up 
his place with those&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Dead but sceptred sovereigns who still 
rule<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our spirits from their urns.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Froude&rsquo;s book is a tomb over which the lovers of 
Carlyle&rsquo;s genius will never cease to shed tender but 
regretful tears.</p>
<p>We doubt whether there is in English literature a more 
triumphant book than Boswell&rsquo;s.&nbsp; What materials for 
tragedy are wanting?&nbsp; Johnson was a man of strong passions, 
unbending spirit, violent temper, as poor as a church-mouse, and 
as proud as the proudest of church dignitaries; endowed with the 
strength of a coal-heaver, the courage of a lion, and the tongue 
of Dean Swift, he could knock down booksellers and silence 
bargees; he was melancholy almost to madness, &lsquo;radically 
wretched,&rsquo; indolent, blinded, diseased.&nbsp; Poverty was 
long his portion; not that genteel poverty that is sometimes 
behindhand with its rent, but that hungry poverty that does not 
know where to look for its dinner.&nbsp; Against all these things
had this &lsquo;old struggler&rsquo; to contend; over all these 
<!-- page 104--><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
104</span>things did this &lsquo;old struggler&rsquo; 
prevail.&nbsp; Over even the fear of death, the giving up of this
&lsquo;intellectual being,&rsquo; which had haunted his gloomy 
fancy for a lifetime, he seems finally to have prevailed, and to 
have met his end as a brave man should.</p>
<p>Carlyle, writing to his wife, says, and truthfully enough, 
&lsquo;The more the devil worries me the more I wring him by the 
nose;&rsquo; but then if the devil&rsquo;s was the only nose that
was wrung in the transaction, why need Carlyle cry out so 
loud?&nbsp; After buffeting one&rsquo;s way through the 
storm-tossed pages of Froude&rsquo;s <i>Carlyle</i>&mdash;in 
which the universe is stretched upon the rack because food 
disagrees with man and cocks crow&mdash;with what thankfulness 
and reverence do we read once again the letter in which Johnson 
tells Mrs. Thrale how he has been called to endure, not dyspepsia
or sleeplessness, but paralysis itself:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;On Monday I sat for my picture, and walked 
a considerable way with little inconvenience.&nbsp; In the 
afternoon and evening I felt myself light and easy, and began to 
plan schemes of life.&nbsp; Thus I went to bed, and, in a short 
time, waked and sat up, as has long been my custom; when I felt a
confusion in my head which <!-- page 105--><a 
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>lasted, I 
suppose, about half a minute; I was alarmed, and prayed God that 
however much He might afflict my body He would spare my 
understanding. . . .&nbsp; Soon after I perceived that I had 
suffered a paralytic stroke, and that my speech was taken from 
me.&nbsp; I had no pain, and so little dejection, in this 
dreadful state, that I wondered at my own apathy, and considered 
that perhaps death itself, when it should come, would excite less
horror than seems now to attend it.&nbsp; In order to rouse the 
vocal organs I took two drams. . . .&nbsp; I then went to bed, 
and, strange as it may seem, I think, slept.&nbsp; When I saw 
light it was time I should contrive what I should do.&nbsp; 
Though God stopped my speech He left me my hand.&nbsp; I enjoyed 
a mercy which was not granted to my dear friend Lawrence, who now
perhaps overlooks me, as I am writing, and rejoices that I have 
what he wanted.&nbsp; My first note was necessarily to my 
servant, who came in talking, and could not immediately 
comprehend why he should read what I put into his hands. . . 
.&nbsp; How this will be received by you I know not.&nbsp; I hope
you will sympathize with me; but perhaps&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;My mistress, gracious, mild, and good,<br />
Cries&mdash;Is he dumb?&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis time he 
shou&rsquo;d.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 106--><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
106</span>&lsquo;I suppose you may wish to know how my disease is
treated by the physicians.&nbsp; They put a blister upon my back,
and two from my ear to my throat, one on a side.&nbsp; The 
blister on the back has done little, and those on the throat have
not risen.&nbsp; I bullied and bounced (it sticks to our last 
sand), and compelled the apothecary to make his salve according 
to the Edinburgh dispensatory, that it might adhere better.&nbsp;
I have now two on my own prescription.&nbsp; They likewise give 
me salt of hartshorn, which I take with no great confidence; but 
I am satisfied that what can be done is done for me.&nbsp; I am 
almost ashamed of this querulous letter, but now it is written 
let it go.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is indeed tonic and bark for the mind.</p>
<p>If, irritated by a comparison that ought never to have been 
thrust upon us, we ask why it is that the reader of Boswell finds
it as hard to help loving Johnson as the reader of Froude finds 
its hard to avoid disliking Carlyle, the answer must be that 
whilst the elder man of letters was full to overflowing with the 
milk of human kindness, the younger one was full to overflowing 
with something not nearly so nice; and that whilst Johnson was 
pre-eminently a reasonable man, reasonable in all his demands 
<!-- page 107--><a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
107</span>and expectations, Carlyle was the most unreasonable 
mortal that ever exhausted the patience of nurse, mother, or 
wife.</p>
<p>Of Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s affectionate nature nobody has written 
with nobler appreciation than Carlyle himself.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Perhaps it is this Divine feeling of affection, throughout
manifested, that principally attracts us to Johnson.&nbsp; A true
brother of men is he, and filial lover of the earth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The day will come when it will be recognised that Carlyle, as 
a critic, is to be judged by what he himself corrected for the 
press, and not by splenetic entries in diaries, or whimsical 
extravagances in private conversation.</p>
<p>Of Johnson&rsquo;s reasonableness nothing need be said, except
that it is patent everywhere.&nbsp; His wife&rsquo;s judgment was
a sound one: &lsquo;He is the most sensible man I ever 
met.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As for his brutality, of which at one time we used to hear a 
great deal, we cannot say of it what Hookham Frere said of 
Landor&rsquo;s immorality, that it was:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Mere imaginary classicality<br />
Wholly devoid of criminal reality.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was nothing of the sort.&nbsp; Dialectically the great 
Doctor was a great brute.&nbsp; The fact is, he had so accustomed
himself to wordy warfare, <!-- page 108--><a 
name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>that he 
lost all sense of moral responsibility, and cared as little for 
men&rsquo;s feelings as a Napoleon did for their lives.&nbsp; 
When the battle was over, the Doctor frequently did what no 
soldier ever did that I have heard tell of, apologized to his 
victims and drank wine or lemonade with them.&nbsp; It must also 
be remembered that for the most part his victims sought him 
out.&nbsp; They came to be tossed and gored.&nbsp; And after all,
are they so much to be pitied?&nbsp; They have our sympathy, and 
the Doctor has our applause.&nbsp; I am not prepared to say, with
the simpering fellow with weak legs whom David Copperfield met at
Mr. Waterbrook&rsquo;s dinner-table, that I would sooner be 
knocked down by a man with blood than picked up by a man without 
any; but, argumentatively speaking, I think it would be better 
for a man&rsquo;s reputation to be knocked down by Dr. Johnson 
than picked up by Mr. Froude.</p>
<p>Johnson&rsquo;s claim to be the best of our talkers cannot, on
our present materials, be contested.&nbsp; For the most part we 
have only talk about other talkers.&nbsp; Johnson&rsquo;s is 
matter of record.&nbsp; Carlyle no doubt was a great 
talker&mdash;no man talked against talk or broke silence to 
praise it more eloquently than he, but unfortunately none of it 
is in evidence.&nbsp; All that is given us <!-- page 109--><a 
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>is a sort 
of Commination Service writ large.&nbsp; We soon weary of 
it.&nbsp; Man does not live by curses alone.</p>
<p>An unhappier prediction of a boy&rsquo;s future was surely 
never made than that of Johnson&rsquo;s by his cousin, Mr. 
Cornelius Ford, who said to the infant Samuel, &lsquo;You will 
make your way the more easily in the world as you are content to 
dispute no man&rsquo;s claim to conversation excellence, and they
will, therefore, more willingly allow your pretensions as a 
writer.&rsquo;&nbsp; Unfortunate Mr. Ford!&nbsp; The man never 
breathed whose claim to conversation excellence Dr. Johnson did 
not dispute on every possible occasion, whilst, just because he 
was admittedly so good a talker, his pretensions as a writer have
been occasionally slighted.</p>
<p>Johnson&rsquo;s personal character has generally been allowed 
to stand high.&nbsp; It, however, has not been submitted to 
recent tests.&nbsp; To be the first to &lsquo;smell a 
fault&rsquo; is the pride of the modern biographer.&nbsp; 
Boswell&rsquo;s artless pages afford useful hints not lightly to 
be disregarded.&nbsp; During some portion of Johnson&rsquo;s 
married life he had lodgings, first at Greenwich, afterwards at 
Hampstead.&nbsp; But he did not always go home o&rsquo; nights; 
sometimes preferring to roam <!-- page 110--><a 
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>the streets
with that vulgar ruffian Savage, who was certainly no fit company
for him.&nbsp; He once actually quarrelled with 
&lsquo;Tetty,&rsquo; who, despite her ridiculous name, was a very
sensible woman with a very sharp tongue, and for a season, like 
stars, they dwelt apart.&nbsp; Of the real merits of this dispute
we must resign ourselves to ignorance.&nbsp; The materials for 
its discussion do not exist; even Croker could not find 
them.&nbsp; Neither was our great moralist as sound as one would 
have liked to see him in the matter of the payment of small 
debts.&nbsp; When he came to die, he remembered several of these 
outstanding accounts; but what assurance have we that he 
remembered them all?&nbsp; One sum of &pound;10 he sent across to
the honest fellow from whom he had borrowed it, with an apology 
for his delay; which, since it had extended over a period of 
twenty years, was not superfluous.&nbsp; I wonder whether he ever
repaid Mr. Dilly the guinea he once borrowed of him to give to a 
very small boy who had just been apprenticed to a printer.&nbsp; 
If he did not, it was a great shame.&nbsp; That he was indebted 
to Sir Joshua in a small loan is apparent from the fact that it 
was one of his three dying requests to that great man that he 
<!-- page 111--><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
111</span>should release him from it, as, of course, the most 
amiable of painters did.&nbsp; The other two requests, it will be
remembered, were to read his Bible, and not to use his brush on 
Sundays.&nbsp; The good Sir Joshua gave the desired promises with
a full heart, for these two great men loved one another; but 
subsequently discovered the Sabbatical restriction not a little 
irksome, and after a while resumed his former practice, arguing 
with himself that the Doctor really had no business to extract 
any such promise.&nbsp; The point is a nice one, and perhaps ere 
this the two friends have met and discussed it in the Elysian 
fields.&nbsp; If so, I hope the Doctor, grown 
&lsquo;angelical,&rsquo; kept his temper with the mild shade of 
Reynolds better than on the historical occasion when he discussed
with him the question of &lsquo;strong drinks.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Against Garrick, Johnson undoubtedly cherished a smouldering 
grudge, which, however, he never allowed anyone but himself to 
fan into flame.&nbsp; His pique was natural.&nbsp; Garrick had 
been his pupil at Edial, near Lichfield; they had come up to town
together with an easy united fortune of 
fourpence&mdash;&lsquo;current coin o&rsquo; the 
realm.&rsquo;&nbsp; Garrick soon had the world at his feet and 
garnered golden grain.&nbsp; Johnson <!-- page 112--><a 
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>became 
famous too, but remained poor and dingy.&nbsp; Garrick surrounded
himself with what only money can buy, good pictures and rare 
books.&nbsp; Johnson cared nothing for pictures&mdash;how should 
he? he could not see them; but he did care a great deal about 
books, and the pernickety little player was chary about lending 
his splendidly bound rarities to his quondam preceptor.&nbsp; Our
sympathies in this matter are entirely with Garrick; Johnson was 
one of the best men that ever lived, but not to lend books 
to.&nbsp; Like Lady Slattern, he had a &lsquo;most observant 
thumb.&rsquo;&nbsp; But Garrick had no real cause for 
complaint.&nbsp; Johnson may have soiled his folios and sneered 
at his trade, but in life Johnson loved Garrick, and in death 
embalmed his memory in a sentence which can only die with the 
English language: &lsquo;I am disappointed by that stroke of 
death which has eclipsed the gaiety of nations, and impoverished 
the public stock of harmless pleasure.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Will it be believed that puny critics have been found to 
quarrel with this colossal compliment on the poor pretext of its 
falsehood?&nbsp; Garrick&rsquo;s death, urge these dullards, 
could not possibly have eclipsed the gaiety of nations, since he 
had retired from the stage months <!-- page 113--><a 
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>previous to
his demise.&nbsp; When will mankind learn that literature is one 
thing, and sworn testimony another?</p>
<p>Johnson&rsquo;s relations with Burke were of a more crucial 
character.&nbsp; The author of <i>Rasselas</i> and <i>The English
Dictionary</i> can never have been really jealous of Garrick, or 
in the very least desirous of &lsquo;bringing down the 
house;&rsquo; but Burke had done nobler things than that.&nbsp; 
He had made politics philosophical, and had at least tried to 
cleanse them from the dust and cobwebs of party.&nbsp; Johnson, 
though he had never sat in the House of Commons, had yet, in his 
capacity of an unauthorized reporter, put into the mouths of 
honourable members much better speeches than ever came out of 
them, and it is no secret that he would have liked to make a 
speech or two on his own account.&nbsp; Burke had made 
many.&nbsp; Harder still to bear, there were not wanting good 
judges to say that, in their opinion, Burke was a better talker 
than the great Samuel himself.&nbsp; To cap it all, was not Burke
a &lsquo;vile Whig&rsquo;?&nbsp; The ordeal was an unusually 
trying one.&nbsp; Johnson emerges triumphant.</p>
<p>Though by no means disposed to hear men made much of, he 
always listened to praise of <!-- page 114--><a 
name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>Burke with 
a boyish delight.&nbsp; He never wearied of it.&nbsp; When any 
new proof of Burke&rsquo;s intellectual prowess was brought to 
his notice, he would exclaim exultingly, &lsquo;Did we not always
say he was a great man?&rsquo;&nbsp; And yet how admirably did 
this &lsquo;poor scholar&rsquo; preserve his independence and 
equanimity of mind!&nbsp; It was not easy to dazzle the 
Doctor.&nbsp; What a satisfactory story that is of Burke showing 
Johnson over his fine estate at Beaconsfield, and expatiating in 
his exuberant style on its &lsquo;liberties, privileges, 
easements, rights, and advantages,&rsquo; and of the old Doctor, 
the tenant of &lsquo;a two-pair back&rsquo; somewhere off Fleet 
Street, peering cautiously about, criticising everything, and 
observing with much coolness&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Non equidem invideo, miror 
magis.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A friendship like this could be disturbed but by death, and 
accordingly we read:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Mr. Langton one day during Johnson&rsquo;s 
last illness found Mr. Burke and four or five more friends 
sitting with Johnson.&nbsp; Mr. Burke said to him, &ldquo;I am 
afraid, sir, such a number of us may be oppressive to 
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; said Johnson, &ldquo;it 
is not so; and I must be in a wretched state indeed when your 
company <!-- page 115--><a name="page115"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 115</span>would not be a delight to 
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Burke, in a tremulous voice, expressive of 
being very tenderly affected, replied: &ldquo;My dear sir, you 
have always been too good to me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Immediately 
afterwards he went away.&nbsp; This was the last circumstance in 
the acquaintance of these two eminent men.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But this is a well-worn theme, though, like some other 
well-worn themes, still profitable for edification or 
rebuke.&nbsp; A hundred years can make no difference to a 
character like Johnson&rsquo;s, or to a biography like 
Boswell&rsquo;s.&nbsp; We are not to be robbed of our conviction 
that this man, at all events, was both great and good.</p>
<p>Johnson the author is not always fairly treated.&nbsp; Phrases
are convenient things to hand about, and it is as little the 
custom to inquire into their truth as it is to read the 
letterpress on banknotes.&nbsp; We are content to count 
banknotes, and to repeat phrases.&nbsp; One of these phrases is, 
that whilst everybody reads Boswell, nobody reads Johnson.&nbsp; 
The facts are otherwise.&nbsp; Everybody does not read Boswell, 
and a great many people do read Johnson.&nbsp; If it be asked, 
What do the general public know of Johnson&rsquo;s nine volumes 
octavo?&nbsp; I reply, Beshrew the general public!&nbsp; What in 
the name of the <!-- page 116--><a name="page116"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 116</span>Bodleian has the general public got 
to do with literature?&nbsp; The general public subscribes to 
Mudie, and has its intellectual, like its lacteal sustenance, 
sent round to it in carts.&nbsp; On Saturdays these carts, laden 
with &lsquo;recent works in circulation,&rsquo; traverse the 
Uxbridge Road; on Wednesdays they toil up Highgate Hill, and if 
we may believe the reports of travellers, are occasionally seen 
rushing through the wilds of Camberwell and bumping over 
Blackheath.&nbsp; It is not a question of the general public, but
of the lover of letters.&nbsp; Do Mr. Browning, Mr. Arnold, Mr. 
Lowell, Mr. Trevelyan, Mr. Stephen, Mr. Morley, know their 
Johnson?&nbsp; &lsquo;To doubt would be disloyalty.&rsquo;&nbsp; 
And what these big men know in their big way hundreds of little 
men know in their little way.&nbsp; We have no writer with a more
genuine literary flavour about him than the great Cham of 
literature.&nbsp; No man of letters loved letters better than 
he.&nbsp; He knew literature in all its branches&mdash;he had 
read books, he had written books, he had sold books, he had 
bought books, and he had borrowed them.&nbsp; Sluggish and inert 
in all other directions, he pranced through libraries.&nbsp; He 
loved a catalogue; he delighted in an index.&nbsp; He was, to 
employ a happy phrase of Dr. Holmes, at home <!-- page 117--><a 
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>amongst 
books, as a stable-boy is amongst horses.&nbsp; He cared 
intensely about the future of literature and the fate of literary
men.&nbsp; &lsquo;I respect Millar,&rsquo; he once exclaimed; 
&lsquo;he has raised the price of literature.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now 
Millar was a Scotchman.&nbsp; Even Horne Tooke was not to stand 
in the pillory: &lsquo;No, no, the dog has too much literature 
for that.&rsquo;&nbsp; The only time the author of 
<i>Rasselas</i> met the author of the <i>Wealth of Nations</i> 
witnessed a painful scene.&nbsp; The English moralist gave the 
Scotch one the lie direct, and the Scotch moralist applied to the
English one a phrase which would have done discredit to the lips 
of a costermonger; <a name="citation117"></a><a 
href="#footnote117" class="citation">[117]</a> but this 
notwithstanding, when Boswell reported that Adam Smith preferred 
rhyme to blank verse, Johnson hailed the news as enthusiastically
as did Cedric the Saxon the English origin of the bravest knights
in the retinue of the Norman king.&nbsp; &lsquo;Did Adam say 
that?&rsquo; he shouted: &lsquo;I love him for it.&nbsp; I could 
hug him!&rsquo;&nbsp; Johnson no doubt honestly believed he held 
George III. in reverence, but really he did not care a 
pin&rsquo;s fee for all the crowned heads of Europe.&nbsp; All 
his reverence <!-- page 118--><a name="page118"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 118</span>was reserved for &lsquo;poor 
scholars.&rsquo;&nbsp; When a small boy in a wherry, on whom had 
devolved the arduous task of rowing Johnson and his biographer 
across the Thames, said he would give all he had to know about 
the Argonauts, the Doctor was much pleased, and gave him, or got 
Boswell to give him, a double fare.&nbsp; He was ever an advocate
of the spread of knowledge amongst all classes and both 
sexes.&nbsp; His devotion to letters has received its fitting 
reward, the love and respect of all &lsquo;lettered 
hearts.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Considering him a little more in detail, we find it plain that
he was a poet of no mean order.&nbsp; His resonant lines, 
informed as they often are with the force of their author&rsquo;s
character&mdash;his strong sense, his fortitude, his 
gloom&mdash;take possession of the memory, and suffuse themselves
through one&rsquo;s entire system of thought.&nbsp; A poet 
spouting his own verses is usually a figure to be avoided; but 
one could be content to be a hundred and thirty next birthday to 
have heard Johnson recite, in his full sonorous voice, and with 
his stately elocution, <i>The Vanity of Human Wishes</i>.&nbsp; 
When he came to the following lines, he usually broke down, and 
who can wonder?&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!-- page 
119--><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
119</span>&lsquo;Proceed, illustrious youth,<br />
And virtue guard thee to the throne of truth!<br />
Yet should thy soul indulge the gen&rsquo;rous heat<br />
Till captive science yields her last retreat;<br />
Should reason guide thee with her brightest ray,<br />
And pour on misty doubt resistless day;<br />
Should no false kindness lure to loose delight,<br />
Nor praise relax, nor difficulty fright;<br />
Should tempting novelty thy cell refrain,<br />
And sloth effuse her opiate fumes in vain;<br />
Should beauty blunt on fops her fatal dart,<br />
Nor claim the triumph of a lettered heart;<br />
Should no disease thy torpid veins invade,<br />
Nor melancholy&rsquo;s phantoms haunt thy shade;<br />
Yet hope not life from grief or danger free,<br />
Nor think the doom of man revers&rsquo;d for thee.<br />
Deign on the passing world to turn thine eyes,<br />
And pause a while from letters to be wise;<br />
There mark what ills the scholar&rsquo;s life assail,<br />
Toil, envy, want, the patron and the gaol.<br />
See nations, slowly wise and meanly just,<br />
To buried merit raise the tardy bust.<br />
If dreams yet flatter, once again attend,<br />
Hear Lydiat&rsquo;s life, and Galileo&rsquo;s end.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If this be not poetry, may the name perish!</p>
<p>In another style, the stanzas on the young heir&rsquo;s 
majority have such great merit as to tempt one to say that the 
author of <i>The Jolly Beggars</i>, Robert Burns himself, might 
have written them.&nbsp; Here are four of them:</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 120--><a name="page120"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 120</span>&lsquo;Loosen&rsquo;d from the 
minor&rsquo;s tether,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Free to mortgage or to sell;<br />
Wild as wind and light as feather,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bid the sons of thrift farewell.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Call the Betseys, Kates, and Jennies,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All the names that banish care,<br />
Lavish of your grandsire&rsquo;s guineas,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Show the spirit of an heir.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wealth, my lad, was made to wander,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Let it wander as it will;<br />
Call the jockey, call the pander,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bid them come and take their fill.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When the bonny blade carouses,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Pockets full and spirits high&mdash;<br />
What are acres? what are houses?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Only dirt&mdash;or wet or dry.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Johnson&rsquo;s prologues, and his lines on the death of 
Robert Levet, are well known.&nbsp; Indeed, it is only fair to 
say that our respected friend, the General Public, frequently has
Johnsonian tags on its tongue:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Slow rises worth by poverty 
depressed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The unconquered lord of pleasure and of 
pain.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He left the name at which the world grew pale<br />
To point a moral or adorn a tale.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Death, kind nature&rsquo;s signal of 
retreat.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Panting Time toiled after him in vain.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 121--><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>All these are Johnson&rsquo;s, who, though he is not, 
like Gray, whom he hated so, all quotations, is yet oftener in 
men&rsquo;s mouths than they perhaps wot of.</p>
<p>Johnson&rsquo;s tragedy, <i>Irene</i>, need not detain 
us.&nbsp; It is unreadable, and to quote his own sensible words, 
&lsquo;It is useless to criticise what nobody reads.&rsquo;&nbsp;
It was indeed the expressed opinion of a contemporary called Pot 
that <i>Irene</i> was the finest tragedy of modern times; but on 
this judgment of Pot&rsquo;s being made known to Johnson, he was 
only heard to mutter, &lsquo;If Pot says so, Pot lies,&rsquo; as 
no doubt he did.</p>
<p>Johnson&rsquo;s Latin Verses have not escaped the condemnation
of scholars.&nbsp; Whose have?&nbsp; The true mode of critical 
approach to copies of Latin verse is by the question&mdash;How 
bad are they?&nbsp; Croker took the opinion of the Marquess 
Wellesley as to the degree of badness of Johnson&rsquo;s Latin 
Exercises.&nbsp; Lord Wellesley, as became so distinguished an 
Etonian, felt the solemnity of the occasion, and, after 
bargaining for secrecy, gave it as his opinion that they were all
very bad, but that some perhaps were worse than others.&nbsp; To 
this judgment I have nothing to add.</p>
<p>As a writer of English prose, Johnson has <!-- page 122--><a 
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>always 
enjoyed a great, albeit a somewhat awful reputation.&nbsp; In 
childish memories he is constrained to be associated with dust 
and dictionaries, and those provoking obstacles to a boy&rsquo;s 
reading&mdash;&lsquo;long words.&rsquo;&nbsp; It would be easy to
select from Johnson&rsquo;s writings numerous passages written in
that essentially vicious style to which the name Johnsonese has 
been cruelly given; but the searcher could not fail to find many 
passages guiltless of this charge.&nbsp; The characteristics of 
Johnson&rsquo;s prose style are colossal good sense, though with 
a strong sceptical bias, good humour, vigorous language, and 
movement from point to point, which can only be compared to the 
measured tread of a well-drilled company of soldiers.&nbsp; Here 
is a passage from the preface to Shakspeare:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Notes are often necessary, but they are 
necessary evils.&nbsp; Let him that is yet unacquainted with the 
powers of Shakspeare, and who desires to feel the highest 
pleasure that the drama can give, read every play from the first 
scene to the last, with utter negligence of all his 
commentators.&nbsp; When his fancy is once on the wing, let it 
not stoop at correction or explanation.&nbsp; When his attention 
is strongly engaged, let it disdain alike to turn <!-- page 
123--><a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
123</span>aside to the name of Theobald and of Pope.&nbsp; Let 
him read on, through brightness and obscurity, through integrity 
and corruption; let him preserve his comprehension of the 
dialogue and his interest in the fable.&nbsp; And when the 
pleasures of novelty have ceased, let him attempt exactness and 
read the commentators.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Where are we to find better sense, or much better English?</p>
<p>In the pleasant art of chaffing an author Johnson has hardly 
an equal.&nbsp; De Quincey too often overdoes it.&nbsp; Macaulay 
seldom fails to excite sympathy with his victim.&nbsp; In 
playfulness Mr. Arnold perhaps surpasses the Doctor, but then the
latter&rsquo;s playfulness is always leonine, whilst Mr. 
Arnold&rsquo;s is surely, sometimes, just a trifle 
kittenish.&nbsp; An example, no doubt a very good one, of 
Johnson&rsquo;s humour must be allowed me.&nbsp; Soame Jenyns, in
his book on the <i>Origin of Evil</i>, had imagined that, as we 
have not only animals for food, but choose some for our 
diversion, the same privilege may be allowed to beings above us, 
&lsquo;who may deceive, torment, or destroy us for the ends only 
of their own pleasure.&rsquo;</p>
<p>On this hint writes our merry Doctor as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 124--><a name="page124"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 124</span>&lsquo;I cannot resist the 
temptation of contemplating this analogy, which I think he might 
have carried farther, very much to the advantage of his 
argument.&nbsp; He might have shown that these &ldquo;hunters, 
whose game is man,&rdquo; have many sports analogous to our 
own.&nbsp; As we drown whelps or kittens, they amuse themselves 
now and then with sinking a ship, and stand round the fields of 
Blenheim, or the walls of Prague, as we encircle a cockpit.&nbsp;
As we shoot a bird flying, they take a man in the midst of his 
business or pleasure, and knock him down with an apoplexy.&nbsp; 
Some of them perhaps are virtuosi, and delight in the operations 
of an asthma, as a human philosopher in the effects of the 
air-pump.&nbsp; Many a merry bout have these frolick beings at 
the vicissitudes of an ague, and good sport it is to see a man 
tumble with an epilepsy, and revive and tumble again, and all 
this he knows not why.&nbsp; The paroxysms of the gout and stone 
must undoubtedly make high mirth, especially if the play be a 
little diversified with the blunders and puzzles of the blind and
deaf. . . .&nbsp; One sport the merry malice of these beings has 
found means of enjoying, to which we have nothing equal or 
similar.&nbsp; They now and then <!-- page 125--><a 
name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>catch a 
mortal, proud of his parts, and flattered either by the 
submission of those who court his kindness, or the notice of 
those who suffer him to court theirs.&nbsp; A head thus prepared 
for the reception of false opinions, and the projection of vain 
designs, they easily fill with idle notions till, in time, they 
make their plaything an author; their first diversion commonly 
begins with an ode or an epistle, then rises perhaps to a 
political irony, and is at last brought to its height by a 
treatise of philosophy.&nbsp; Then begins the poor animal to 
entangle himself in sophisms and to flounder in 
absurdity.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The author of the philosophical treatise, <i>A Free Inquiry 
into the Nature and Origin of Evil</i>, did not at all enjoy this
&lsquo;merry bout&rsquo; of the &lsquo;frolick&rsquo; 
Johnson.</p>
<p>The concluding paragraphs of Johnson&rsquo;s Preface to his 
Dictionary are historical prose, and if we are anxious to find 
passages fit to compare with them in the melancholy roll of their
cadences and in their grave sincerity and manly emotion, we must,
I think, take a flying jump from Dr. Johnson to Dr. Newman.</p>
<p>For sensible men the world offers no better reading than the 
<i>Lives of the Poets</i>.&nbsp; They afford an admirable example
of the manner of man <!-- page 126--><a name="page126"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 126</span>Johnson was.&nbsp; The subject was 
suggested to him by the booksellers, whom as a body he never 
abused.&nbsp; Himself the son of a bookseller, he respected their
calling.&nbsp; If they treated him with civility, he responded 
suitably.&nbsp; If they were rude to him he knocked them 
down.&nbsp; These worthies chose their own poets.&nbsp; Johnson 
remained indifferent.&nbsp; He knew everybody&rsquo;s poetry, and
was always ready to write anybody&rsquo;s Life.&nbsp; If he knew 
the facts of a poet&rsquo;s life&mdash;and his knowledge was 
enormous on such subjects&mdash;he found room for them; if he did
not, he supplied their place with his own shrewd reflections and 
sombre philosophy of life.&nbsp; It thus comes about that Johnson
is every bit as interesting when he is writing about Sprat, or 
Smith, or Fenton, as he is when he has got Milton or Gray in 
hand.&nbsp; He is also much less provoking.&nbsp; My own 
favourite <i>Life</i> is that of Sir Richard Blackmore.</p>
<p>The poorer the poet the kindlier is the treatment he 
receives.&nbsp; Johnson kept all his rough words for Shakspeare, 
Milton, and Gray.</p>
<p>In this trait, surely an amiable one, he was much resembled by
that eminent man the late Sir George Jessel, whose civility to a 
barrister was always in inverse ratio to the barrister&rsquo;s 
<!-- page 127--><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
127</span>practice; and whose friendly zeal in helping young and 
nervous practitioners over the stiles of legal difficulty was 
only equalled by the fiery enthusiasm with which he thrust back 
the Attorney and Solicitor General and people of that sort.</p>
<p>As a political thinker Johnson has not had justice.&nbsp; He 
has been lightly dismissed as the last of the old-world 
Tories.&nbsp; He was nothing of the sort.&nbsp; His cast of 
political thought is shared by thousands to this day.&nbsp; He 
represents that vast army of electors whom neither canvasser nor 
caucus has ever yet cajoled or bullied into a 
polling-booth.&nbsp; Newspapers may scold, platforms may shake; 
whatever circulars can do may be done, all that placards can tell
may be told; but the fact remains that one-third of every 
constituency in the realm shares Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s 
&lsquo;narcotic indifference,&rsquo; and stays away.</p>
<p>It is, of course, impossible to reconcile all Johnson&rsquo;s 
recorded utterances with any one view of anything.&nbsp; When 
crossed in conversation or goaded by folly he was capable of 
anything.&nbsp; But his dominant tone about politics was 
something of this sort.&nbsp; Provided a man lived in a State 
which guaranteed him private <!-- page 128--><a 
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>liberty and
secured him public order, he was very much of a knave or 
altogether a fool if he troubled himself further.&nbsp; To go to 
bed when you wish, to get up when you like, to eat and drink and 
read what you choose, to say across your port or your tea 
whatever occurs to you at the moment, and to earn your living as 
best you may&mdash;this is what Dr. Johnson meant by private 
liberty.&nbsp; Fleet Street open day and night&mdash;this is what
he meant by public order.&nbsp; Give a sensible man these, and 
take all the rest the world goes round.&nbsp; Tyranny was a 
bugbear.&nbsp; Either the tyranny was bearable, or it was 
not.&nbsp; If it was bearable, it did not matter; and as soon as 
it became unbearable the mob cut off the tyrant&rsquo;s head, and
wise men went home to their dinner.&nbsp; To views of this sort 
he gave emphatic utterance on the well-known occasion when he 
gave Sir Adam Ferguson a bit of his mind.&nbsp; Sir Adam had 
innocently enough observed that the Crown had too much 
power.&nbsp; Thereupon Johnson:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Sir, I perceive you are a vile Whig.&nbsp; 
Why all this childish jealousy of the power of the Crown?&nbsp; 
The Crown has not power enough.&nbsp; When I say that all 
governments are alike, I consider that in no government power can
be <!-- page 129--><a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
129</span>abused long; mankind will not bear it.&nbsp; If a 
sovereign oppresses his people, they will rise and cut off his 
head.&nbsp; There is a remedy in human nature against tyranny 
that will keep us safe under every form of government.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not, and never was, the language of Toryism.&nbsp; It 
is a much more intellectual &lsquo;ism.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is 
indifferentism.&nbsp; So, too, in his able pamphlet, <i>The False
Alarm</i>, which had reference to Wilkes and the Middlesex 
election, though he no doubt attempts to deal with the 
constitutional aspect of the question, the real strength of his 
case is to be found in passages like the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The grievance which has produced all this 
tempest of outrage, the oppression in which all other oppressions
are included, the invasion which has left us no property, the 
alarm that suffers no patriot to sleep in quiet, is comprised in 
a vote of the House of Commons, by which the freeholders of 
Middlesex are deprived of a Briton&rsquo;s 
birthright&mdash;representation in Parliament.&nbsp; They have, 
indeed, received the usual writ of election; but that writ, alas!
was malicious mockery; they were insulted with the form, but 
denied the reality, for there was one man excepted from their 
choice.&nbsp; The <!-- page 130--><a name="page130"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 130</span>character of the man, thus fatally 
excepted, I have no purpose to delineate.&nbsp; Lampoon itself 
would disdain to speak ill of him of whom no man speaks 
well.&nbsp; Every lover of liberty stands doubtful of the fate of
posterity, because the chief county in England cannot take its 
representative from a gaol.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Temperament was of course at the bottom of this 
indifference.&nbsp; Johnson was of melancholy humour and 
profoundly sceptical.&nbsp; Cynical he was not&mdash;he loved his
fellow-men; his days were full of</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Little, nameless, unremembered acts<br />
Of kindness and of love.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But he was as difficult to rouse to enthusiasm about humanity 
as is Mr. Justice Stephen.&nbsp; He pitied the poor devils, but 
he did not believe in them.&nbsp; They were neither happy nor 
wise, and he saw no reason to believe they would ever become 
either.&nbsp; &lsquo;Leave me alone,&rsquo; he cried to the 
sultry mob, bawling &lsquo;Wilkes and Liberty.&rsquo;&nbsp; 
&lsquo;I at least am not ashamed to own that I care for neither 
the one nor the other.&rsquo;</p>
<p>No man, however, resented more fiercely than Johnson any 
unnecessary interference with men who were simply going their own
way.&nbsp; The Highlanders only knew Gaelic, yet political <!-- 
page 131--><a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
131</span>wiseacres were to be found objecting to their having 
the Bible in their own tongue.&nbsp; Johnson flew to arms: he 
wrote one of his monumental letters; the opposition was quelled, 
and the Gael got his Bible.&nbsp; So too the wicked interference 
with Irish enterprise, so much in vogue during the last century, 
infuriated him.&nbsp; &lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; he said to Sir Thomas 
Robinson, &lsquo;you talk the language of a savage.&nbsp; What, 
sir! would you prevent any people from feeding themselves, if by 
any honest means they can do so?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Were Johnson to come to life again, total abstainer as he 
often was, he would, I expect, denounce the principle involved in
&lsquo;Local Option.&rsquo;&nbsp; I am not at all sure he would 
not borrow a guinea from a bystander and become a subscriber to 
the &lsquo;Property Defence League;&rsquo; and though it is 
notorious that he never read any book all through, and never 
could be got to believe that anybody else ever did, he would, I 
think, read a larger fraction of Mr. Spencer&rsquo;s pamphlet, 
&lsquo;<i>Man</i> versus <i>the State</i>,&rsquo; than of any 
other &lsquo;recent work in circulation.&rsquo;&nbsp; The state 
of the Strand, when two vestries are at work upon it, would, I am
sure, drive him into open rebellion.</p>
<p>As a letter-writer Johnson has great merits.&nbsp; <!-- page 
132--><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
132</span>Let no man despise the epistolary art.&nbsp; It is said
to be extinct.&nbsp; I doubt it.&nbsp; Good letters were always 
scarce.&nbsp; It does not follow that, because our grandmothers 
wrote long letters, they all wrote good ones, or that nobody 
nowadays writes good letters because most people write bad 
ones.&nbsp; Johnson wrote letters in two styles.&nbsp; One was 
monumental&mdash;more suggestive of the chisel than the 
pen.&nbsp; In the other there are traces of the same style, but, 
like the old Gothic architecture, it has grown domesticated, and 
become the fit vehicle of plain tidings of joy and 
sorrow&mdash;of affection, wit, and fancy.&nbsp; The letter to 
Lord Chesterfield is the most celebrated example of the 
monumental style.&nbsp; From the letters to Mrs. Thrale many good
examples of the domesticated style might be selected One must 
suffice:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Queeney has been a good girl, and wrote me 
a letter.&nbsp; If Burney said she would write, she told you a 
fib.&nbsp; She writes nothing to me.&nbsp; She can write home 
fast enough.&nbsp; I have a good mind not to tell her that Dr. 
Bernard, to whom I had recommended her novel, speaks of it with 
great commendation, and that the copy which she lent me has been 
read by Dr. Lawrence three times over.&nbsp; And yet what <!-- 
page 133--><a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
133</span>a gipsy it is.&nbsp; She no more minds me than if I 
were a Branghton.&nbsp; Pray, speak to Queeney to write again. . 
. .&nbsp; Now you think yourself the first writer in the world 
for a letter about nothing.&nbsp; Can you write such a letter as 
this?&nbsp; So miscellaneous, with such noble disdain of 
regularity, like Shakspeare&rsquo;s works; such graceful 
negligence of transition, like the ancient enthusiasts.&nbsp; The
pure voice of Nature and of Friendship.&nbsp; Now, of whom shall 
I proceed to speak? of whom but Mrs. Montague?&nbsp; Having 
mentioned Shakspeare and Nature, does not the name of Montague 
force itself upon me?&nbsp; Such were the transitions of the 
ancients, which now seem abrupt, because the intermediate idea is
lost to modern understandings.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the extract had better end, for there are, (I fear) 
&lsquo;modern understandings who will not perceive the 
intermediate idea&rsquo; between Shakspeare and Mrs. Montague, 
and to whom even the name of Branghton will suggest no 
meaning.</p>
<p>Johnson&rsquo;s literary fame is, in our judgment, as secure 
as his character.&nbsp; Like the stone which he placed over his 
father&rsquo;s grave at Lichfield, and which, it is shameful to 
think, <!-- page 134--><a name="page134"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 134</span>has been removed, it is &lsquo;too 
massy and strong&rsquo; to be ever much affected by the wind and 
weather of our literary atmosphere.&nbsp; &lsquo;Never,&rsquo; so
he wrote to Mrs. Thrale, &lsquo;let criticisms operate upon your 
face or your mind; it is very rarely that an author is hurt by 
his critics.&nbsp; The blaze of reputation cannot be blown out; 
but it often dies in the socket.&nbsp; From the author of 
<i>Fitzosborne&rsquo;s Letters</i> I cannot think myself in much 
danger.&nbsp; I met him only once, about thirty years ago, and in
some small dispute soon reduced him to whistle.&rsquo;&nbsp; Dr. 
Johnson is in no danger from anybody.&nbsp; None but Gargantua 
could blow him out, and he still burns brightly in his 
socket.</p>
<p>How long this may continue who can say?&nbsp; It is a far cry 
to 1985.&nbsp; Science may by that time have squeezed out 
literature, and the author of the <i>Lives of the Poets</i> may 
be dimly remembered as an odd fellow who lived in the Dark Ages, 
and had a very creditable fancy for making chemical 
experiments.&nbsp; On the other hand, the Spiritualists may be in
possession, in which case the Cock Lane Ghost will occupy more of
public attention than Boswell&rsquo;s hero, who will, perhaps, be
reprobated as the profane utterer of these idle words: 
&lsquo;Suppose <!-- page 135--><a name="page135"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 135</span>I know a man to be so lame that he 
is absolutely incapable to move himself, and I find him in a 
different room from that in which I left him, shall I puzzle 
myself with idle conjectures, that perhaps his nerves have by 
some unknown change all at once become effective?&nbsp; No, sir, 
it is clear how he got into a different room&mdash;he was 
<i>carried</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>We here part company with Johnson, bidding him a most 
affectionate farewell, and leaving him in undisturbed possession 
of both place and power.&nbsp; His character will bear 
investigation, and some of his books perusal.&nbsp; The latter, 
indeed, may be submitted to his own test, and there is no truer 
one.&nbsp; A book, he wrote, should help us either to enjoy life 
or to endure it.&nbsp; His frequently do both.</p>
<h2><!-- page 136--><a name="page136"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 136</span>EDMUND BURKE.</h2>
<p><i>A Lecture delivered before the Edinburgh Philosophical 
Society</i>.</p>
<p>Mr. John Morley, who amongst other things has written two 
admirable books about Edmund Burke, is to be found in the Preface
to the second of them apologizing for having introduced into the 
body of the work extracts from his former volume&mdash;conduct 
which he seeks to justify by quoting from the Greek (always a 
desirable thing to do when in difficulty), to prove that, though 
you may say what you have to say well once, you cannot so say it 
twice.</p>
<p>A difficulty somewhat of the same kind cannot fail to be felt 
by everyone who takes upon himself to write on Burke; for however
innocent a man&rsquo;s own past life may be of any public 
references to the subject, the very many good things other men 
have said about it must seriously interfere with true liberty of 
treatment.</p>
<p><!-- page 137--><a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span>Hardly any man, and certainly no politician, has been 
so bepraised as Burke, whose very name, suggesting, as it does, 
splendour of diction, has tempted those who would praise him to 
do so in a highly decorated style, and it would have been easy 
work to have brought together a sufficient number of animated 
passages from the works of well-known writers all dedicated to 
the greater glory of Edmund Burke, and then to have tagged on 
half-a-dozen specimens of his own resplendent rhetoric, and so to
have come to an apparently natural and long-desired conclusion 
without exciting any more than the usual post-lectorial 
grumble.</p>
<p>This course, however, not recommending itself, some other 
method had to be discovered.&nbsp; Happily, it is out of the 
question within present limits to give any proper summary of 
Burke&rsquo;s public life.&nbsp; This great man was not like some
modern politicians, a specialist, confining his activities within
the prospectus of an association; nor was he, like some others, a
thing of shreds and patches, busily employed to-day picking up 
the facts with which he will overwhelm his opponents on the 
morrow; but was one ever ready to engage with all comers on all 
subjects from out the stores of his accumulated <!-- page 
138--><a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
138</span>knowledge.&nbsp; Even were we to confine ourselves to 
those questions only which engaged Burke&rsquo;s most powerful 
attention, enlisted his most active sympathy, elicited his most 
bewitching rhetoric, we should still find ourselves called upon 
to grapple with problems as vast and varied as Economic Reform, 
the Status of our Colonies, our Empire in India, our relations 
with Ireland both in respect to her trade and her prevalent 
religion; and then, blurring the picture, as some may 
think&mdash;certainly rendering it Titanesque and gloomy&mdash;we
have the spectacle of Burke in his old age, like another Laocoon,
writhing and wrestling with the French Revolution; and it may 
serve to give us some dim notion of how great a man Burke was, of
how affluent a mind, of how potent an imagination, of how 
resistless an energy, that even when his sole unassisted name is 
pitted against the outcome of centuries, and we say Burke and the
French Revolution, we are not overwhelmed by any sense of obvious
absurdity or incongruity.</p>
<p>What I propose to do is merely to consider a little 
Burke&rsquo;s life prior to his obtaining a seat in Parliament, 
and then to refer to any circumstances which may help us to 
account for the <!-- page 139--><a name="page139"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 139</span>fact that this truly extraordinary 
man, whose intellectual resources beggar the imagination, and who
devoted himself to politics with all the forces of his nature, 
never so much as attained to a seat in the Cabinet&mdash;a feat 
one has known to be accomplished by persons of no proved 
intellectual agility.&nbsp; Having done this, I shall then, 
bearing in mind the aphorism of Lord Beaconsfield, that it is 
always better to be impudent than servile, essay an analysis of 
the essential elements of Burke&rsquo;s character.</p>
<p>The first great fact to remember is that the Edmund Burke we 
are all agreed in regarding as one of the proudest memories of 
the House of Commons was an Irishman.&nbsp; When we are in our 
next fit of political depression about that island, and are about
piously to wish, as the poet Spenser tells us men were wishing 
even in his time, that it were not adjacent, let us do a little 
national stocktaking, and calculate profits as well as 
losses.&nbsp; Burke was not only an Irishman, but a typical 
one&mdash;of the very kind many Englishmen, and even possibly 
some Scotchmen, make a point of disliking.&nbsp; I do not say he 
was an aboriginal Irishman, but his ancestors are said to have 
settled in the county of Galway, under Strongbow, in King Henry 
<!-- page 140--><a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
140</span>the Second&rsquo;s time, when Ireland was first 
conquered and our troubles began.&nbsp; This, at all events, is a
better Irish pedigree than Mr. Parnell&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Skipping six centuries, we find Burke&rsquo;s father an 
attorney in Dublin&mdash;which somehow sounds a very Irish thing 
to be&mdash;who in 1725 married a Miss Nagle, and had fifteen 
children.&nbsp; The marriage of Burke&rsquo;s parents was of the 
kind called mixed&mdash;a term which doubtless admits of wide 
application, but when employed technically signifies that the 
religious faith of the spouses was different; one, the father, 
being a Protestant, and the lady an adherent to what used to be 
pleasantly called the &lsquo;old religion.&rsquo;&nbsp; The 
severer spirit now dominating Catholic councils has condemned 
these marriages, on the score of their bad theology and their lax
morality; but the practical politician, who is not usually much 
of a theologian&mdash;though Lord Melbourne and Mr. Gladstone are
distinguished exceptions&mdash;and whose moral conscience is apt 
to be robust (and here I believe there are no exceptions), cannot
but regret that so good an opportunity of lubricating religious 
differences with the sweet oil of the domestic affections should 
be lost to us in these days of bitterness <!-- page 141--><a 
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>and 
dissension.&nbsp; Burke was brought up in the Protestant faith of
his father, and was never in any real danger of deviating from 
it; but I cannot doubt that his regard for his Catholic 
fellow-subjects, his fierce repudiation of the infamies of the 
Penal Code&mdash;the horrors of which he did something to 
mitigate&mdash;his respect for antiquity, and his historic sense,
were all quickened by the fact that a tenderly loved and loving 
mother belonged through life and in death to an ancient and an 
outraged faith.</p>
<p>The great majority of Burke&rsquo;s brothers and sisters, like
those of Laurence Sterne, were &lsquo;not made to live;&rsquo; 
and out of the fifteen but three, beside himself, attained 
maturity.&nbsp; These were his eldest brother Garrett, on whose 
death Edmund succeeded to the patrimonial Irish estate, which he 
sold; his younger brother, Richard, a highly speculative 
gentleman, who always lost; and his sister, Juliana, who married 
a Mr. French, and was, as became her mother&rsquo;s daughter, a 
rigid Roman Catholic&mdash;who, so we read, was accustomed every 
Christmas Day to invite to the Hall the maimed, the aged, and 
distressed of her vicinity to a plentiful repast, during which 
she waited upon them as a servant.&nbsp; <!-- page 142--><a 
name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>A sister 
like this never did any man any serious harm.</p>
<p>Edmund Burke was born in 1729, in Dublin, and was taught his 
rudiments in the country&mdash;first by a Mr. O&rsquo;Halloran, 
and afterwards by a Mr. FitzGerald, village pedagogues both, who 
at all events succeeded in giving their charge a brogue which 
death alone could silence.&nbsp; Burke passed from their hands to
an academy at Ballitore, kept by a Quaker, whence he proceeded to
Trinity College, Dublin.&nbsp; He was thus not only Irish born, 
but Irish bred.&nbsp; His intellectual habit of mind exhibited 
itself early.&nbsp; He belonged to the happy family of omnivorous
readers, and, in the language of his latest schoolmaster, he went
to college with a larger miscellaneous stock of reading than was 
usual with one of his years; which, being interpreted out of 
pedagogic into plain English, means that &lsquo;our good 
Edmund&rsquo; was an enormous devourer of poetry and novels, and 
so he remained to the end of his days.&nbsp; That he always 
preferred Fielding to Richardson is satisfactory, since it pairs 
him off nicely with Dr. Johnson, whose preference was the other 
way, and so helps to keep an interesting question wide 
open.&nbsp; His passion for the poetry of Virgil is 
significant.&nbsp; <!-- page 143--><a name="page143"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 143</span>His early devotion to Edward Young, 
the grandiose author of the <i>Night Thoughts</i>, is not to be 
wondered at; though the inspiration of the youthful Burke, either
as poet or critic, may be questioned, when we find him 
rapturously scribbling in the margin of his copy:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Jove claimed the verse old Homer sung,<br 
/>
But God Himself inspired Dr. Young.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But a boy&rsquo;s enthusiasm for a favourite poet is a thing 
to rejoice over.&nbsp; The years that bring the philosophic mind 
will not bring&mdash;they must find&mdash;enthusiasm.</p>
<p>In 1750 Burke (being then twenty-one) came for the first time 
to London, to do what so many of his lively young countrymen are 
still doing&mdash;though they are beginning to make a grievance 
even of that&mdash;eat his dinners at the Middle Temple, and so 
qualify himself for the Bar.&nbsp; Certainly that student was in 
luck who found himself in the same mess with Burke; and yet so 
stupid are men&mdash;so prone to rest with their full weight on 
the immaterial and slide over the essential&mdash;that had that 
good fortune been ours we should probably have been more taken up
with Burke&rsquo;s brogue than with his brains.&nbsp; Burke came 
to London with a cultivated curiosity, and <!-- page 144--><a 
name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>in no 
spirit of desperate determination to make his fortune.&nbsp; That
the study of the law interested him cannot be doubted, for 
everything interested him, particularly the stage.&nbsp; Like the
sensible Irishman he was, he lost his heart to Peg Woffington on 
the first opportunity.&nbsp; He was fond of roaming about the 
country during, it is to be hoped, vacation-time only, and is to 
be found writing the most cheerful letters to his friends in 
Ireland (all of whom are persuaded that he is going some day to 
be somebody, though sorely puzzled to surmise what thing or when,
so pleasantly does he take life), from all sorts of 
out-of-the-way country places, where he lodges with quaint old 
landladies who wonder maternally why he never gets drunk, and 
generally mistake him for an author until he pays his bill.&nbsp;
When in town he frequented debating societies in Fleet Street and
Covent Garden, and made his first speeches; for which purpose he 
would, unlike some debaters, devote studious hours to getting up 
the subjects to be discussed.&nbsp; There is good reason to 
believe that it was in this manner his attention was first 
directed to India.&nbsp; He was at all times a great talker, and,
Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s dictum notwithstanding, a good 
listener.&nbsp; He was endlessly interested <!-- page 145--><a 
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>in 
everything&mdash;in the state of the crops, in the last play, in 
the details of all trades, the rhythm of all poems, the plots of 
all novels, and indeed in the course of every manufacture.&nbsp; 
And so for six years he went up and down, to and fro, gathering 
information, imparting knowledge, and preparing himself, though 
he knew not for what.</p>
<p>The attorney in Dublin grew anxious, and searched for 
precedents of a son behaving like his, and rising to 
eminence.&nbsp; Had his son got the legal mind?&mdash;which, 
according to a keen observer, chiefly displays itself by 
illustrating the obvious, explaining the evident, and expatiating
on the commonplace.&nbsp; Edmund&rsquo;s powers of illustration, 
explanation, and expatiation could not indeed be questioned; but 
then the subjects selected for the exhibition of those powers 
were very far indeed from being obvious, evident, or commonplace,
and the attorney&rsquo;s heart grew heavy within him.&nbsp; The 
paternal displeasure was signified in the usual manner&mdash;the 
supplies were cut off.&nbsp; Edmund Burke, however, was no 
ordinary prodigal, and his reply to his father&rsquo;s 
expostulations took the unexpected and unprecedented shape of a 
copy of a second and enlarged edition of his treatise on the 
<i>Sublime and <!-- page 146--><a name="page146"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 146</span>Beautiful</i>, which he had 
published in 1756 at the price of three shillings.&nbsp; 
Burke&rsquo;s father promptly sent the author a bank-bill for 
&pound;100&mdash;conduct on his part which, considering he had 
sent his son to London and maintained him there for six years to 
study law, was, in my judgment, both sublime and beautiful.&nbsp;
In the same year Burke published another pamphlet&mdash;a 
one-and-sixpenny affair&mdash;written ironically in the style of 
Lord Bolingbroke, and called <i>A Vindication of Natural 
Society</i>; <i>or</i>, <i>A View of the Miseries and Evils 
arising to Mankind from Every Species of Civil Society</i>.&nbsp;
Irony is a dangerous weapon for a public man to have ever 
employed, and in after-life Burke had frequently to explain that 
he was not serious.&nbsp; On these two pamphlets&rsquo; airy 
pinions Burke floated into the harbour of literary fame.&nbsp; No
less a man than the great David Hume referred to him, in a letter
to the hardly less great Adam Smith, as an Irish gentleman who 
had written a &lsquo;very pretty treatise on the 
Sublime.&rsquo;&nbsp; After these efforts Burke, as became an 
established wit, went to Bath to recruit, and there, fitly 
enough, fell in love.&nbsp; The lady was Miss Jane Mary Nugent, 
the daughter of a celebrated Bath physician, and it is pleasant 
to be able to say of <!-- page 147--><a name="page147"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 147</span>the marriage that was shortly 
solemnized between the young couple, that it was a happy one, and
then to go on our way, leaving them&mdash;where man and wife 
ought to be left&mdash;alone.&nbsp; Oddly enough, Burke&rsquo;s 
wife was also the offspring of a &lsquo;mixed 
marriage&rsquo;&mdash;only in her case it was the father who was 
the Catholic; consequently both Mr. and Mrs. Edmund Burke were of
the same way of thinking, but each had a parent of the other 
way.&nbsp; Although getting married is no part of the curriculum 
of a law student, Burke&rsquo;s father seems to have come to the 
conclusion that after all it was a greater distinction for an 
attorney in Dublin to have a son living amongst the wits in 
London, and discoursing familiarly on the &lsquo;Sublime and 
Beautiful,&rsquo; than one prosecuting some poor countryman, with
a brogue as rich as his own, for stealing a pair of breeches; for
we find him generously allowing the young couple &pound;200 a 
year, which no doubt went some way towards maintaining 
them.&nbsp; Burke, who was now in his twenty-eighth year, seems 
to have given up all notion of the law.&nbsp; In 1758 he wrote 
for Dodsley the first volume of the <i>Annual Register</i>, a 
melancholy series which continues to this day.&nbsp; For doing 
this he got &pound;100.&nbsp; Burke was by this time a well-known
figure in London <!-- page 148--><a name="page148"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 148</span>literary society, and was busy 
making for himself a huge private reputation.&nbsp; The Christmas
Day of 1758 witnessed a singular scene at the dinner table of 
David Garrick.&nbsp; Dr. Johnson, then in full vigour of his 
mind, and with the all-dreaded weapons of his dialectics kept 
burnished by daily use, was flatly contradicted by a fellow-guest
some twenty years his junior, and, what is more, submitted to it 
without a murmur.&nbsp; One of the diners, Arthur Murphy, was so 
struck by this occurrence, unique in his long experience of the 
Doctor, that on returning home he recorded the fact in his 
journal, but ventured no explanation of it.&nbsp; It can only be 
accounted for&mdash;so at least I venture to think&mdash;by the 
combined effect of four wholly independent circumstances: 
<i>First</i>, the day was Christmas Day, a day of peace and 
goodwill, and our beloved Doctor was amongst the sincerest, 
though most argumentative, of Christians, and a great observer of
days.&nbsp; <i>Second</i>, the house was David Garrick&rsquo;s, 
and consequently we may be certain that the dinner had been a 
superlatively good one; and has not Boswell placed on record 
Johnson&rsquo;s opinion of the man who professed to be 
indifferent about his dinner?&nbsp; <i>Third</i>, the subject 
under discussion was India, about which Johnson knew he <!-- page
149--><a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
149</span>knew next to nothing.&nbsp; And <i>fourth</i>, the 
offender was Edmund Burke, whom Johnson loved from the first day 
he set eyes upon him to their last sad parting by the waters of 
death.</p>
<p>In 1761 that shrewd old gossip, Horace Walpole, met Burke for 
the first time at dinner, and remarks of him in a letter to 
George Montague:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I dined at Hamilton&rsquo;s yesterday; 
there were Garrick, and young Mr. Burke, who wrote a book in the 
style of Lord Bolingbroke, that was much admired.&nbsp; He is a 
sensible man, but has not worn off his authorism yet, and thinks 
there is nothing so charming as writers, and to be one.&nbsp; He 
will know better one of these days.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But great as were Burke&rsquo;s literary powers, and 
passionate as was his fondness for letters and for literary 
society, he never seems to have felt that the main burden of his 
life lay in that direction.&nbsp; He looked to the public 
service, and this though he always believed that the pen of a 
great writer was a more powerful and glorious weapon than any to 
be found in the armoury of politics.&nbsp; This faith of his 
comes out sometimes queerly enough.&nbsp; For example, when Dr. 
Robertson in 1777 sent Burke his <!-- page 150--><a 
name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>cheerful 
<i>History of America</i>, in quarto volumes, Burke, in the most 
perfect good faith, closes a long letter of thanks 
thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;You will smile when I send you a trifling 
temporary production made for the occasion of the day, and to 
perish with it, in return for your immortal work.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have no desire, least of all in Edinburgh, to say anything 
disrespectful of Principal Robertson; but still, when we remember
that the temporary production he got in exchange for his 
<i>History of America</i> was Burke&rsquo;s immortal letter to 
the Sheriffs of Bristol on the American War, we must, I think, be
forced to admit that, as so often happens when a Scotchman and an
Irishman do business together, the former got the better of the 
bargain.</p>
<p>Burke&rsquo;s first public employment was of a humble 
character, and might well have been passed over in a sentence, 
had it not terminated in a most delightful quarrel, in which 
Burke conducted himself like an Irishman of genius.&nbsp; Some 
time in 1759 he became acquainted with William Gerard Hamilton, 
commonly called &lsquo;Single-speech Hamilton,&rsquo; on account 
of the celebrity he gained from his first speech in Parliament, 
and the steady way in which his <!-- page 151--><a 
name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>oratorical 
reputation went on waning ever after.&nbsp; In 1761 this 
gentleman went over to Ireland as Chief Secretary, and Burke 
accompanied him as the Secretary&rsquo;s secretary, or, in the 
unlicensed speech of Dublin, as Hamilton&rsquo;s jackal.&nbsp; 
This arrangement was eminently satisfactory to Hamilton, who 
found, as generations of men have found after him, Burke&rsquo;s 
brains very useful, and he determined to borrow them for the 
period of their joint lives.&nbsp; Animated by this desire, in 
itself praiseworthy, he busied himself in procuring for Burke a 
pension of &pound;300 a year on the Irish establishment, and then
the simple &lsquo;Single-speech&rsquo; thought the transaction 
closed.&nbsp; He had bought his poor man of genius, and paid for 
him on the nail with other people&rsquo;s money.&nbsp; Nothing 
remained but for Burke to draw his pension and devote the rest of
his life to maintaining Hamilton&rsquo;s reputation.&nbsp; There 
is nothing at all unusual in this, and I have no doubt Burke 
would have stuck to his bargain, had not Hamilton conceived the 
fatal idea that Burke&rsquo;s brains were <i>exclusively</i> his 
(Hamilton&rsquo;s).&nbsp; Then the situation became one of risk 
and apparent danger.</p>
<p>Burke&rsquo;s imagination began playing round the subject: he 
saw himself a slave, blotted out <!-- page 152--><a 
name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>of 
existence&mdash;mere fuel for Hamilton&rsquo;s flame.&nbsp; In a 
week he was in a towering passion.&nbsp; Few men can afford to be
angry.&nbsp; It is a run upon their intellectual resources they 
cannot meet.&nbsp; But Burke&rsquo;s treasury could well afford 
the luxury; and his letters to Hamilton make delightful reading 
to those who, like myself, dearly love a dispute when conducted 
according to the rules of the game by men of great intellectual 
wealth.&nbsp; Hamilton demolished and reduced to stony silence, 
Burke sat down again and wrote long letters to all his friends, 
telling them the whole story from beginning to end.&nbsp; I must 
be allowed a quotation from one of these letters, for this really
is not so frivolous a matter as I am afraid I have made it 
appear&mdash;a quotation of which this much may be said, that 
nothing more delightfully Burkean is to be found 
anywhere:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear 
Mason</span>,&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am hardly able to tell you how much satisfaction I 
had in your letter.&nbsp; Your approbation of my conduct makes me
believe much the better of you and myself; and I assure you that 
that approbation came to me very seasonably.&nbsp; Such proofs of
a warm, sincere, <!-- page 153--><a name="page153"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 153</span>and disinterested friendship were 
not wholly unnecessary to my support at a time when I experienced
such bitter effects of the perfidy and ingratitude of much longer
and much closer connections.&nbsp; The way in which you take up 
my affairs binds me to you in a manner I cannot express; for, to 
tell you the truth, I never can (knowing as I do the principles 
upon which I always endeavour to act) submit to any sort of 
compromise of my character; and I shall never, therefore, look 
upon those who, after hearing the whole story, do not think me 
<i>perfectly</i> in the right, and do not consider Hamilton an 
infamous scoundrel, to be in the smallest degree my friends, or 
even to be persons for whom I am bound to have the slightest 
esteem, as fair and just estimators of the characters and conduct
of men.&nbsp; Situated as I am, and feeling as I do, I should be 
just as well pleased that they totally condemned me as that they 
should say there were faults on both sides, or that it was a 
disputable case, as I hear is (I cannot forbear saying) the 
affected language of some persons. . . .&nbsp; You cannot avoid 
remarking, my dear Mason, and I hope not without some 
indignation, the unparalleled singularity of my situation.&nbsp; 
<!-- page 154--><a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
154</span>Was ever a man before me expected to enter into formal,
direct, and undisguised slavery?&nbsp; Did ever man before him 
confess an attempt to decoy a man into such an alleged contract, 
not to say anything of the impudence of regularly pleading 
it?&nbsp; If such an attempt be wicked and unlawful (and I am 
sure no one ever doubted it), I have only to confess his charge, 
and to admit myself his dupe, to make him pass, on his own 
showing, for the most consummate villain that ever lived.&nbsp; 
The only difference between us is, not whether he is not a 
rogue&mdash;for he not only admits but pleads the facts that 
demonstrate him to be so; but only whether I was such a fool as 
to sell myself absolutely for a consideration which, so far from 
being adequate, if any such could be adequate, is not even so 
much as certain.&nbsp; Not to value myself as a gentleman, a free
man, a man of education, and one pretending to literature; is 
there any situation in life so low, or even so criminal, that can
subject a man to the possibility of such an engagement?&nbsp; 
Would you dare attempt to bind your footman to such terms?&nbsp; 
Will the law suffer a felon sent to the plantations to bind 
himself for his life, and to renounce all possibility either of 
elevation <!-- page 155--><a name="page155"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 155</span>or quiet?&nbsp; And am I to defend 
myself for not doing what no man is suffered to do, and what it 
would be criminal in any man to submit to?&nbsp; You will excuse 
me for this heat.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I not only excuse Burke for his heat, but love him for letting
me warm my hands at it after a lapse of a hundred and twenty 
years.</p>
<p>Burke was more fortunate in his second master, for in 1765 
being then thirty-six years of age, he became private secretary 
to the new Prime Minister, the Marquis of Rockingham; was by the 
interest of Lord Verney returned to Parliament for Wendover, in 
Bucks; and on January 27th, 1766, his voice was first heard in 
the House of Commons.</p>
<p>The Rockingham Ministry deserves well of the historian, and on
the whole has received its deserts.&nbsp; Lord Rockingham, the 
Duke of Richmond, Lord John Cavendish, Mr. Dowdeswell, and the 
rest of them, were good men and true, judged by an ordinary 
standard; and when contrasted with most of their political 
competitors, they almost approach the ranks of saints and 
angels.&nbsp; However, after a year and twenty days, his Majesty 
King George the Third managed to <!-- page 156--><a 
name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>get rid of 
them, and to keep them at bay for fifteen years.&nbsp; But their 
first term of office, though short, lasted long enough to 
establish a friendship of no ordinary powers of endurance between
the chief members of the party and the Prime Minister&rsquo;s 
private secretary, who was at first, so ran the report, supposed 
to be a wild Irishman, whose real name was O&rsquo;Bourke, and 
whose brogue seemed to require the allegation that its owner was 
a popish emissary.&nbsp; It is satisfactory to notice how from 
the very first Burke&rsquo;s intellectual pre-eminence, 
character, and aims were clearly admitted and most cheerfully 
recognised by his political and social superiors; and in the long
correspondence in which he engaged with most of them there is not
a trace to be found, on one side or the other, of anything 
approaching to either patronage or servility.&nbsp; Burke advises
them, exhorts them, expostulates with them, condemns their 
aristocratic languor, fans their feeble flames, drafts their 
motions, dictates their protests, visits their houses, and 
generally supplies them with facts, figures, poetry, and 
romance.&nbsp; To all this they submit with much humility.&nbsp; 
The Duke of Richmond once indeed ventured to hint to Burke, with 
exceeding delicacy, that he (the Duke) had a <!-- page 157--><a 
name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>small 
private estate to attend to as well as public affairs; but the 
validity of the excuse was not admitted.&nbsp; The part Burke 
played for the next fifteen years with relation to the Rockingham
party reminds me of the functions I have observed performed in 
lazy families by a soberly clad and eminently respectable person 
who pays them domiciliary visits, and, having admission 
everywhere, goes about mysteriously from room to room, winding up
all the clocks.&nbsp; This is what Burke did for the Rockingham 
party&mdash;he kept it going.</p>
<p>But fortunately for us, Burke was not content with private 
adjuration, or even public speech.&nbsp; His literary instincts, 
his dominating desire to persuade everybody that he, Edmund 
Burke, was absolutely in the right, and every one of his 
opponents hopelessly wrong, made him turn to the pamphlet as a 
propaganda, and in his hands</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The thing became a trumpet, whence he 
blew<br />
Soul-animating strains.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So accustomed are we to regard Burke&rsquo;s pamphlets as 
specimens of our noblest literature, and to see them printed in 
comfortable volumes, that we are apt to forget that in their 
origin they were but the children of the pavement, <!-- page 
158--><a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
158</span>the publications of the hour.&nbsp; If, however, you 
ever visit any old public library, and grope about a little, you 
are likely enough to find a shelf holding some twenty-five or 
thirty musty, ugly little books, usually lettered 
&lsquo;Burke,&rsquo; and on opening any of them you will come 
across one of Burke&rsquo;s pamphlets as originally issued, bound
up with the replies and counter-pamphlets it occasioned.&nbsp; I 
have frequently tried, but always in vain, to read these replies,
which are pretentious enough&mdash;usually the works of deans, 
members of Parliament, and other dignitaries of the class Carlyle
used compendiously to describe as 
&lsquo;shovel-hatted&rsquo;&mdash;and each of whom was as much 
entitled to publish pamphlets as Burke himself.&nbsp; There are 
some things it is very easy to do, and to write a pamphlet is one
of them; but to write such a pamphlet as future generations will 
read with delight is perhaps the most difficult feat in 
literature.&nbsp; Milton, Swift, Burke, and Sydney Smith are, I 
think, our only great pamphleteers.</p>
<p>I have now rather more than kept my word so far as 
Burke&rsquo;s pre-parliamentary life is concerned, and will 
proceed to mention some of the circumstances that may serve to 
account for the fact that, when the Rockingham party came into 
<!-- page 159--><a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
159</span>power for the second time in 1782, Burke, who was their
life and soul, was only rewarded with a minor office.&nbsp; 
First, then, it must be recorded sorrowfully of Burke that he was
always desperately in debt, and in this country no politician 
under the rank of a baronet can ever safely be in debt.&nbsp; 
Burke&rsquo;s finances are, and always have been, marvels and 
mysteries; but one thing must be said of them&mdash;that the 
malignity of his enemies, both Tory enemies and Radical enemies, 
has never succeeded in formulating any charge of dishonesty 
against him that has not been at once completely pulverized, and 
shown on the facts to be impossible. <a name="citation159"></a><a
href="#footnote159" class="citation">[159]</a>&nbsp; 
Burke&rsquo;s purchase of the estate at Beaconsfield in 1768, 
only two years after he entered Parliament, consisting as it did 
of a good house and 1,600 acres of land, has puzzled a great many
good men&mdash;<!-- page 160--><a name="page160"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 160</span>much more than it ever did Edmund 
Burke.&nbsp; But how did he get the money?&nbsp; After an Irish 
fashion&mdash;by not getting it at all.&nbsp; Two-thirds of the 
purchase-money remained on mortgage, and the balance he borrowed;
or, as he puts it, &lsquo;With all I could collect of my own, and
by the aid of my friends, I have established a root in the 
country.&rsquo;&nbsp; That is how Burke bought Beaconsfield, 
where he lived till his end came; whither he always hastened when
his sensitive mind was tortured by the thought of how badly men 
governed the world; where he entertained all sorts and conditions
of men&mdash;Quakers, Brahmins (for whose ancient rites he 
provided suitable accommodation in a greenhouse), nobles and 
abb&eacute;s flying from revolutionary France, poets, painters, 
and peers; no one of whom ever long remained a stranger to his 
charm.&nbsp; Burke flung himself into farming with all the 
enthusiasm of his nature.&nbsp; His letters to Arthur Young on 
the subject of carrots still tremble with emotion.&nbsp; You all 
know Burke&rsquo;s <i>Thoughts on the Present 
Discontents</i>.&nbsp; You remember&mdash;it is hard to 
forget&mdash;his speech on Conciliation with America, 
particularly the magnificent passage beginning, 
&lsquo;Magnanimity in politics is not seldom the truest wisdom, 
and a great <!-- page 161--><a name="page161"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 161</span>empire and little minds go ill 
together.&rsquo;&nbsp; You have echoed back the words in which, 
in his letter to the Sheriffs of Bristol on the hateful American 
War, he protests that it was not instantly he could be brought to
rejoice when he heard of the slaughter and captivity of long 
lists of those whose names had been familiar in his ears from his
infancy, and you would all join with me in subscribing to a fund 
which should have for its object the printing and hanging up over
every editor&rsquo;s desk in town and country a subsequent 
passage from the same letter:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;A conscientious man would be cautious how 
he dealt in blood.&nbsp; He would feel some apprehension at being
called to a tremendous account for engaging in so deep a play 
without any knowledge of the game.&nbsp; It is no excuse for 
presumptuous ignorance that it is directed by insolent 
passion.&nbsp; The poorest being that crawls on earth, contending
to save itself from injustice and oppression, is an object 
respectable in the eyes of God and man.&nbsp; But I cannot 
conceive any existence under heaven (which in the depths of its 
wisdom tolerates all sorts of things) that is more truly odious 
and disgusting than an impotent, helpless creature, without civil
wisdom or military skill, <!-- page 162--><a 
name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>bloated 
with pride and arrogance, calling for battles which he is not to 
fight, and contending for a violent dominion which he can never 
exercise. . . .</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you and I find our talents not of the great and 
ruling kind, our conduct at least is conformable to our 
faculties.&nbsp; No man&rsquo;s life pays the forfeit of our 
rashness.&nbsp; No desolate widow weeps tears of blood over our 
ignorance.&nbsp; Scrupulous and sober in a well-grounded distrust
of ourselves, we would keep in the port of peace and security; 
and perhaps in recommending to others something of the same 
diffidence, we should show ourselves more charitable to their 
welfare than injurious to their abilities.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You have laughed over Burke&rsquo;s account of how all Lord 
Talbot&rsquo;s schemes for the reform of the king&rsquo;s 
household were dashed to pieces, because the turnspit of the 
king&rsquo;s kitchen was a Member of Parliament.&nbsp; You have 
often pondered over that miraculous passage in his speech on the 
Nabob of Arcot&rsquo;s debts, describing the devastation of the 
Carnatic by Hyder Ali&mdash;a passage which Mr. John Morley says 
fills the young orator with the same emotions of enthusiasm, 
emulation, and despair that (according <!-- page 163--><a 
name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>to the same
authority) invariably torment the artist who first gazes on 
&lsquo;The Madonna&rsquo; at Dresden, or the figures of 
&lsquo;Night&rsquo; and &lsquo;Dawn&rsquo; at Florence.&nbsp; All
these things you know, else are you mighty self-denying of your 
pleasures.&nbsp; But it is just possible you may have forgotten 
the following extract from one of Burke&rsquo;s farming letters 
to Arthur Young:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;One of the grand points in controversy (a 
controversy indeed chiefly carried on between practice and 
speculation) is that of <i>deep ploughing</i>.&nbsp; In your last
volume you seem, on the whole, rather against that practice, and 
have given several reasons for your judgment which deserve to be 
very well considered.&nbsp; In order to know how we ought to 
plough, we ought to know what end it is we propose to ourselves 
in that operation.&nbsp; The first and instrumental end is to 
divide the soil; the last and ultimate end, so far as regards the
plants, is to facilitate the pushing of the blade upwards, and 
the shooting of the roots in all the inferior directions.&nbsp; 
There is further proposed a more ready admission of external 
influences&mdash;the rain, the sun, the air, charged with all 
those heterogeneous contents, some, possibly all, of which are 
necessary for the nourishment of the plants.&nbsp; <!-- page 
164--><a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>By
ploughing deep you answer these ends in a greater mass of the 
soil.&nbsp; This would seem in favour of deep ploughing as 
nothing else than accomplishing, in a more perfect manner, those 
very ends for which you are induced to plough at all.&nbsp; But 
doubts here arise, only to be solved by experiment.&nbsp; First, 
is it quite certain that it is good for the ear and grain of 
farinaceous plants that their roots should spread and descend 
into the ground to the greatest possible distances and 
depths?&nbsp; Is there not some limit in this?&nbsp; We know that
in timber, what makes one part flourish does not equally conduce 
to the benefit of all; and that which may be beneficial to the 
wood, does not equally contribute to the quantity and goodness of
the fruit; and, <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>, that what increases the 
fruit largely is often far from serviceable to the tree.&nbsp; 
Secondly, is that looseness to great depths, supposing it is 
useful to one of the species of plants, equally useful to 
all?&nbsp; Thirdly, though the external influences&mdash;the 
rain, the sun, the air&mdash;act undoubtedly a part, and a large 
part, in vegetation, does it follow that they are equally 
salutary in any quantities, at any depths?&nbsp; Or that, though 
it may be useful to diffuse one of these agents as extensively as
<!-- page 165--><a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
165</span>may be in the earth, that therefore it will be equally 
useful to render the earth in the same degree pervious to 
all?&nbsp; It is a dangerous way of reasoning in physics, as well
as morals, to conclude, because a given proportion of anything is
advantageous, that the double will be quite as good, or that it 
will be good at all.&nbsp; Neither in the one nor the other is it
always true that two and two make four.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is magnificent, but it is not farming, and you will 
easily believe that Burke&rsquo;s attempts to till the soil were 
more costly than productive.&nbsp; Farming, if it is to pay, is a
pursuit of small economies; and Burke was far too Asiatic, 
tropical, and splendid to have anything to do with small 
economies.&nbsp; His expenditure, like his rhetoric, was in the 
&lsquo;grand style.&rsquo;&nbsp; He belongs to Charles 
Lamb&rsquo;s great race, &lsquo;the men who borrow.&rsquo;&nbsp; 
But indeed it was not so much that Burke borrowed as that men 
lent.&nbsp; Right-feeling men did not wait to be asked.&nbsp; Dr.
Brocklesby, that good physician, whose name breathes like a 
benediction through the pages of the biographies of the best men 
of his time, who soothed Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s last melancholy 
hours, and for whose supposed heterodoxy the dying man displayed 
so tender a solicitude, <!-- page 166--><a 
name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>wrote to 
Burke, in the strain of a timid suitor proposing for the hand of 
a proud heiress, to know whether Burke would be so good as to 
accept &pound;1,000 at once, instead of waiting for the 
writer&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; Burke felt no hesitation in obliging 
so old a friend.&nbsp; Garrick, who, though fond of money, was as
generous-hearted a fellow as ever brought down a house, lent 
Burke &pound;1,000.&nbsp; Sir Joshua Reynolds, who has been 
reckoned stingy, by his will left Burke &pound;2,000, and forgave
him another &pound;2,000 which he had lent him.&nbsp; The Marquis
of Rockingham by his will directed all Burke&rsquo;s bonds held 
by him to be cancelled.&nbsp; They amounted to 
&pound;30,000.&nbsp; Burke&rsquo;s patrimonial estate was sold by
him for &pound;4,000; and I have seen it stated that he had 
received altogether from family sources as much as 
&pound;20,000.&nbsp; And yet he was always poor, and was glad at 
the last to accept pensions from the Crown in order that he might
not leave his wife a beggar.&nbsp; This good lady survived her 
illustrious husband twelve years, and seemed as his widow to have
had some success in paying his bills, for at her death all 
remaining demands were found to be discharged.&nbsp; For 
receiving this pension Burke was assailed by the Duke of Bedford,
a most pleasing act of ducal fatuity, <!-- page 167--><a 
name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>since it 
enabled the pensioner, not bankrupt of his wit, to write a 
pamphlet, now of course a cherished classic, and introduce into 
it a few paragraphs about the House of Russell and the cognate 
subject of grants from the Crown.&nbsp; But enough of 
Burke&rsquo;s debts and difficulties, which I only mention 
because all through his life they were cast up against him.&nbsp;
Had Burke been a moralist of the calibre of Charles James Fox, he
might have amassed a fortune large enough to keep up half a dozen
Beaconsfields, by simply doing what all his predecessors in the 
office he held, including Fox&rsquo;s own father, the truly 
infamous first Lord Holland, had done&mdash;namely, by retaining 
for his own use the interest on all balances of the public money 
from time to time in his hands as Paymaster of the Forces.&nbsp; 
But Burke carried his passion for good government into actual 
practice, and, cutting down the emoluments of his office to a 
salary (a high one, no doubt), effected a saving to the country 
of some &pound;25,000 a year, every farthing of which might have 
gone without remark into his own pocket.</p>
<p>Burke had no vices, save of style and temper; nor was any of 
his expenditure a profligate squandering of money.&nbsp; It all 
went in giving <!-- page 168--><a name="page168"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 168</span>employment or disseminating 
kindness.&nbsp; He sent the painter Barry to study art in 
Italy.&nbsp; He saved the poet Crabbe from starvation and 
despair, and thus secured to the country one who owns the 
unrivalled distinction of having been the favourite poet of the 
three greatest intellectual factors of the age (scientific men 
excepted)&mdash;Lord Byron, Sir Walter Scott, and Cardinal 
Newman.&nbsp; Yet so distorted are men&rsquo;s views that the 
odious and anti-social excesses of Fox at the gambling-table are 
visited with a blame usually wreathed in smiles, whilst the 
financial irregularities of a noble and pure-minded man are 
thought fit matter for the fiercest censure or the most lordly 
contempt.</p>
<p>Next to Burke&rsquo;s debts, some of his companions and 
intimates did him harm and injured his consequence.&nbsp; His 
brother Richard, whose brogue we are given to understand was 
simply appalling, was a good-for-nothing, with a dilapidated 
reputation.&nbsp; Then there was another Mr. Burke, who was no 
relation, but none the less was always about, and to whom it was 
not safe to lend money.&nbsp; Burke&rsquo;s son, too, whose death
he mourned so pathetically, seems to have been a failure, and is 
described by a candid friend as <!-- page 169--><a 
name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>a 
nauseating person.&nbsp; To have a decent following is important 
in politics.</p>
<p>A third reason must be given: Burke&rsquo;s judgment of men 
and things was often both wrong and violent.&nbsp; The story of 
Powell and Bembridge, two knaves in Burke&rsquo;s own office, 
whose cause he espoused, and whom he insisted on reinstating in 
the public service after they had been dismissed, and maintaining
them there, in spite of all protests, till the one had the grace 
to cut his throat and the other was sentenced by the 
Queen&rsquo;s Bench to a term of imprisonment and a heavy fine, 
is too long to be told, though it makes interesting reading in 
the twenty-second volume of Howell&rsquo;s <i>State Trials</i>, 
where at the end of the report is to be found the following 
note:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The proceedings against Messrs. Powell and 
Bembridge occasioned much animated discussion in the House of 
Commons, in which Mr. Burke warmly supported the accused.&nbsp; 
The compassion which on these and all other occasions was 
manifested by Mr. Burke for the sufferings of those public 
delinquents, the zeal with which he advocated their cause, and 
the eagerness with which he endeavoured to extenuate their 
criminality, have received severe <!-- page 170--><a 
name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
170</span>reprehension, and in particular when contrasted with 
his subsequent conduct in the prosecution of Mr. 
Hastings.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The real reason for Burke&rsquo;s belief in Bembridge is, I 
think, to be found in the evidence Burke gave on his behalf at 
the trial before Lord Mansfield.&nbsp; Bembridge had rendered 
Burke invaluable assistance in carrying out his reforms at the 
Paymaster&rsquo;s Office, and Burke was constitutionally unable 
to believe that a rogue could be on his side; but, indeed, Burke 
was too apt to defend bad causes with a scream of passion, and a 
politician who screams is never likely to occupy a commanding 
place in the House of Commons.&nbsp; A last reason for 
Burke&rsquo;s exclusion from high office is to be found in his 
aversion to any measure of Parliamentary Reform.&nbsp; An ardent 
reformer like the Duke of Richmond&mdash;the then Duke of 
Richmond&mdash;who was in favour of annual parliaments, universal
suffrage, and payment of members, was not likely to wish to 
associate himself too closely with a politician who wept with 
emotion at the bare thought of depriving Old Sarum of 
parliamentary representation.</p>
<p>These reasons account for Burke&rsquo;s exclusion, and jealous
as we naturally and properly are of <!-- page 171--><a 
name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>genius 
being snubbed by mediocrity, my reading at all events does not 
justify me in blaming any one but the Fates for the circumstance 
that Burke was never a Secretary of State.&nbsp; And after all, 
does it matter much what he was?&nbsp; Burke no doubt 
occasionally felt his exclusion a little hard; but he is the 
victor who remains in possession of the field; and Burke is now, 
for us and for all coming after us, in such possession.</p>
<p>It now only remains for me, drawing upon my stock of 
assurance, to essay the analysis of the essential elements of 
Burke&rsquo;s mental character, and I therefore at once proceed 
to say that it was Burke&rsquo;s peculiarity and his glory to 
apply the imagination of a poet of the first order to the facts 
and the business of life.&nbsp; Arnold says of Sophocles:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;He saw life steadily, and saw it 
whole.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Substitute for the word &lsquo;life&rsquo; the words 
&lsquo;organised society,&rsquo; and you get a peep into 
Burke&rsquo;s mind.&nbsp; There was a catholicity about his 
gaze.&nbsp; He knew how the whole world lived.&nbsp; Everything 
contributed to this: his vast desultory reading; his education, 
neither wholly academical nor entirely professional; his long 
years of apprenticeship in the service of knowledge; <!-- page 
172--><a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
172</span>his wanderings up and down the country; his vast 
conversational powers; his enormous correspondence with all sorts
of people; his unfailing interest in all pursuits, trades, 
manufactures&mdash;all helped to keep before him, like motes 
dancing in a sunbeam, the huge organism of modern society, which 
requires for its existence and for its development the 
maintenance of credit and of order.&nbsp; Burke&rsquo;s 
imagination led him to look out over the whole land: the 
legislator devising new laws, the judge expounding and enforcing 
old ones, the merchant despatching his goods and extending his 
credit, the banker advancing the money of his customers upon the 
credit of the merchant, the frugal man slowly accumulating the 
store which is to support him in old age, the ancient 
institutions of Church and University with their seemly 
provisions for sound learning and true religion, the parson in 
his pulpit, the poet pondering his rhymes, the farmer eyeing his 
crops, the painter covering his canvases, the player educating 
the feelings.&nbsp; Burke saw all this with the fancy of a poet, 
and dwelt on it with the eye of a lover.&nbsp; But love is the 
parent of fear, and none knew better than Burke how thin is the 
lava layer between the costly fabric of society and the <!-- page
173--><a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
173</span>volcanic heats and destroying flames of anarchy.&nbsp; 
He trembled for the fair frame of all established things, and to 
his horror saw men, instead of covering the thin surface with the
concrete, digging in it for abstractions, and asking fundamental 
questions about the origin of society, and why one man should be 
born rich and another poor.&nbsp; Burke was no prating optimist: 
it was his very knowledge how much could be said against society 
that quickened his fears for it.&nbsp; There is no shallower 
criticism than that which accuses Burke in his later years of 
apostasy from so-called Liberal opinions.&nbsp; Burke was all his
life through a passionate maintainer of the established order of 
things, and a ferocious hater of abstractions and metaphysical 
politics.&nbsp; The same ideas that explode like bombs through 
his diatribes against the French Revolution are to be found 
shining with a mild effulgence in the comparative calm of his 
earlier writings.&nbsp; I have often been struck with a 
resemblance, which I hope is not wholly fanciful, between the 
attitude of Burke&rsquo;s mind towards government and that of 
Cardinal Newman towards religion.&nbsp; Both these great men 
belong, by virtue of their imaginations, to the poetic order, and
they both are to be found dwelling with amazing eloquence, <!-- 
page 174--><a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
174</span>detail, and wealth of illustration on the varied 
elements of society.&nbsp; Both seem as they write to have one 
hand on the pulse of the world, and to be for ever alive to the 
throb of its action; and Burke, as he regarded humanity swarming 
like bees into and out of their hives of industry, is ever asking
himself, How are these men to be saved from anarchy? whilst 
Newman puts to himself the question, How are these men to be 
saved from atheism?&nbsp; Both saw the perils of free inquiry 
divorced from practical affairs.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Civil freedom,&rsquo; says Burke, &lsquo;is not, as 
many have endeavoured to persuade you, a thing that lies hid in 
the depth of abstruse science.&nbsp; It is a blessing and a 
benefit, not an abstract speculation, and all the just reasoning 
that can be upon it is of so coarse a texture as perfectly to 
suit the ordinary capacities of those who are to enjoy and of 
those who are to defend it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tell men,&rsquo; says Cardinal Newman, &lsquo;to gain 
notions of a Creator from His works, and if they were to set 
about it (which nobody does), they would be jaded and wearied by 
the labyrinth they were tracing; their minds would be gorged and 
surfeited by the logical operation.&nbsp; To most men argument 
makes the point in hand more doubtful and considerably <!-- page 
175--><a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
175</span>less impressive.&nbsp; After all, man is not a 
reasoning animal, he is a seeing, feeling, contemplating, actual 
animal.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Burke is fond of telling us that he is no lawyer, no 
antiquarian, but a plain, practical man; and the Cardinal, in 
like manner, is ever insisting that he is no theologian&mdash;he 
leaves everything of that sort to the schools, whatever they may 
be, and simply deals with religion on its practical side as a 
benefit to mankind.</p>
<p>If either of these great men has been guilty of intellectual 
excesses, those of Burke may be attributed to his dread of 
anarchy, those of Newman to his dread of atheism.&nbsp; Neither 
of them was prepared to rest content with a scientific frontier, 
an imaginary line.&nbsp; So much did they dread their enemy, so 
alive were they to the terrible strength of some of his 
positions, that they could not agree to dispense with the 
protection afforded by the huge mountains of prejudice and the 
ancient rivers of custom.&nbsp; The sincerity of either man can 
only be doubted by the bigot and the fool.</p>
<p>But Burke, apart from his fears, had a constitutional love for
old things, simply because they were old.&nbsp; Anything mankind 
had ever worshipped, or venerated, or obeyed, was dear <!-- page 
176--><a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>to
him.&nbsp; I have already referred to his providing his Brahmins 
with a greenhouse for the purpose of their rites, which he 
watched from outside with great interest.&nbsp; One cannot fancy 
Cardinal Newman peeping through a window to see men worshipping 
false though ancient gods.&nbsp; Warren Hastings&rsquo; 
high-handed dealings with the temples and time-honoured if 
scandalous customs of the Hindoos filled Burke with horror.&nbsp;
So, too, he respected Quakers, Presbyterians, Independents, 
Baptists, and all those whom he called Constitutional 
Dissenters.&nbsp; He has a fine passage somewhere about Rust, for
with all his passion for good government he dearly loved a little
rust.&nbsp; In this phase of character he reminds one not a 
little of another great writer&mdash;whose death literature has 
still reason to deplore&mdash;George Eliot; who, in her love for 
old hedgerows and barns and crumbling moss-grown walls, was a 
writer after Burke&rsquo;s own heart, whose novels he would have 
sat up all night to devour; for did he not deny with warmth 
Gibbon&rsquo;s statement that he had read all five volumes of 
<i>Evelina</i> in a day?&nbsp; &lsquo;The thing is 
impossible,&rsquo; cried Burke; &lsquo;they took me three days 
doing nothing else.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now, <i>Evelina</i> is a good 
novel, but <i>Silas Marner</i> is a better.</p>
<p><!-- page 177--><a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
177</span>Wordsworth has been called the High Priest of 
Nature.&nbsp; Burke may be called the High Priest of 
Order&mdash;a lover of settled ways, of justice, peace, and 
security.&nbsp; His writings are a storehouse of wisdom, not the 
cheap shrewdness of the mere man of the world, but the noble, 
animating wisdom of one who has the poet&rsquo;s heart as well as
the statesman&rsquo;s brain.&nbsp; Nobody is fit to govern this 
country who has not drunk deep at the springs of Burke.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Have you read your Burke?&rsquo; is at least as sensible a
question to put to a parliamentary candidate, as to ask him 
whether he is a total abstainer or a desperate drunkard.&nbsp; 
Something there may be about Burke to regret, and more to 
dispute; but that he loved justice and hated iniquity is certain,
as also it is that for the most part he dwelt in the paths of 
purity, humanity, and good sense.&nbsp; May we be found adhering 
to them!</p>
<h2><!-- page 178--><a name="page178"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 178</span>THE MUSE OF HISTORY.</h2>
<p>Two distinguished men of letters, each an admirable 
representative of his University&mdash;Mr. John Morley and 
Professor Seeley&mdash;have lately published opinions on the 
subject of history, which, though very likely to prove right, 
deserve to be carefully considered before assent is bestowed upon
them.</p>
<p>Mr. Morley, when President of the Midland Institute, and 
speaking in the Town Hall of Birmingham, said: &lsquo;I do not in
the least want to know what happened in the past, except as it 
enables me to see my way more clearly through what is happening 
to-day,&rsquo; and this same indifference is professed, though 
certainly nowhere displayed, in other parts of Mr. Morley&rsquo;s
writings. <a name="citation178"></a><a href="#footnote178" 
class="citation">[178]</a></p>
<p>Professor Seeley never makes his point quite so sharp as this,
and probably would hesitate to <!-- page 179--><a 
name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>do so, but 
in the <i>Expansion of England</i> he expounds a theory of 
history largely based upon an indifference like that which Mr. 
Morley professed at Birmingham.&nbsp; His book opens thus: 
&lsquo;It is a favourite maxim of mine that history, while it 
should be scientific in its method, should pursue a practical 
object&mdash;that is, it should not merely gratify the 
reader&rsquo;s curiosity about the past, but modify his view of 
the present and his forecast of the future.&nbsp; Now, if this 
maxim be sound, the history of England ought to end with 
something that might be called a moral.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This, it must be admitted, is a large order.&nbsp; The task of
the historian, as here explained, is not merely to tell us the 
story of the past, and thus gratify our curiosity, but, pursuing 
a practical object, to seek to modify our views of the present 
and help us in our forecasts of the future, and this the 
historian is to do, not unconsciously and incidentally, but 
deliberately and of set purpose.&nbsp; One can well understand 
how history, so written, will usually begin with a maxim, and 
invariably end with a moral.</p>
<p>What we are afterwards told in the same book follows in 
logical sequence upon our first quotation&mdash;namely, that 
&lsquo;history fades into <i>mere <!-- page 180--><a 
name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
180</span>literature</i> (the italics are ours), when it loses 
sight of its relation to practical politics.&rsquo;&nbsp; In this
grim sentence we read the dethronement of Clio.&nbsp; The poor 
thing must forswear her father&rsquo;s house, her tuneful 
sisters, the invocation of the poet, the worship of the 
dramatist, and keep her terms at the University, where, if she is
really studious and steady, and avoids literary companions (which
ought not to be difficult), she may hope some day to be received 
into the Royal Society as a second-rate science.&nbsp; The people
who do not usually go to the Royal Society will miss their old 
playmate from her accustomed slopes, but, even were they to 
succeed in tracing her to her new home, access would be denied 
them; for Professor Seeley, that stern custodian, has his answer 
ready for all such seekers.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you want recreation, 
you must find it in Poetry, particularly Lyrical Poetry.&nbsp; 
Try Shelley.&nbsp; We can no longer allow you to disport 
yourselves in the Fields of History as if they were a mere 
playground.&nbsp; Clio is enclosed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At present, however, this is not quite the case; for the old 
literary traditions are still alive, and prove somewhat 
irritating to Professor Seeley, who, though one of the most 
even-tempered <!-- page 181--><a name="page181"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 181</span>of writers, is to be found on p. 173
almost angry with Thackeray, a charming person, who, as we all 
know, had, after his lazy literary fashion, made an especial 
study of Queen Anne&rsquo;s time, and who cherished the pleasant 
fancy that a man might lie in the heather with a pipe in his 
mouth, and yet, if he had only an odd volume of the 
<i>Spectator</i> or the <i>Tatler</i> in his hand, be learning 
history all the time.&nbsp; &lsquo;As we read in these delightful
pages,&rsquo; says the author of <i>Esmond</i>, &lsquo;the past 
age returns; the England of our ancestors is revivified; the 
Maypole rises in the Strand; the beaux are gathering in the 
coffee-houses;&rsquo; and so on, in the style we all know and 
love so well, and none better, we may rest assured, than 
Professor Seeley himself, if only he were not tortured by the 
thought that people were taking this to be a specimen of the 
science of which he is a Regius Professor.&nbsp; His comment on 
this passage of Thackeray&rsquo;s is almost a groan.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;What is this but the old literary groove, leading to no 
trustworthy knowledge?&rsquo; and certainly no one of us, from 
letting his fancy gaze on the Maypole in the Strand, could ever 
have foretold the Griffin.&nbsp; On the same page he cries: 
&lsquo;Break the drowsy spell of narrative.&nbsp; Ask yourself 
<!-- page 182--><a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
182</span>questions, set yourself problems; your mind will at 
once take up a new attitude.&nbsp; Now, modern English history 
breaks up into two grand problems&mdash;the problem of the 
Colonies and the problem of India.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Cambridge 
School of History with a vengeance!</p>
<p>In a paper read at the South Kensington Museum in 1884, 
Professor Seeley observes: &lsquo;The essential point is this, 
that we should recognise that to study history is to study not 
merely a narrative, but <i>at the same time</i> certain 
theoretical studies.&rsquo;&nbsp; He then proceeds to name 
them:&mdash;Political philosophy, the comparative study of legal 
institutions, political economy, and international law.</p>
<p>These passages are, I think, adequate to give a fair view of 
Professor Seeley&rsquo;s position.&nbsp; History is a science, to
be written scientifically and to be studied scientifically in 
conjunction with other studies.&nbsp; It should pursue a 
practical object and be read with direct reference to practical 
politics&mdash;using the latter word, no doubt, in an enlightened
sense.&nbsp; History is not a narrative of all sorts of 
facts&mdash;biographical, moral, political&mdash;but of such 
facts as a scientific diagnosis has ascertained to be 
historically interesting.&nbsp; In fine, history, if her study is
to <!-- page 183--><a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
183</span>be profitable and not a mere pastime, less exhausting 
than skittles and cheaper than horse exercise, must be dominated 
by some theory capable of verification by reference to certain 
ascertained facts belonging to a particular class.&nbsp; Is this 
the right way of looking upon history?&nbsp; The dictionaries 
tell us that history and story are the same word, and are derived
from a Greek source, signifying information obtained by 
inquiry.&nbsp; The natural definition of history, therefore, 
surely is the story of man upon earth, and the historian is he 
who tells us any chapter or fragment of that story.&nbsp; All 
things that on earth do dwell have, no doubt, their history as 
well as man; but when a member, however humble, of the human race
speaks of history without any explanatory context, he may be 
presumed to be alluding to his own family records, to the story 
of humanity during its passage across the earth&rsquo;s 
surface.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A talent for history&rsquo;&mdash;I am quoting from an 
author whose style, let those mock at it who may, will reveal 
him&mdash;&lsquo;may be said to be born with us as our chief 
inheritance.&nbsp; History has been written with quipo-threads, 
with feather pictures, with wampum belts, still oftener with 
earth-mounds and monumental stone-heaps, <!-- page 184--><a 
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>whether as 
pyramid or cairn; for the Celt and the Copt, the red man as well 
as the white, lives between two eternities, and warring against 
oblivion, he would fain unite himself in clear, conscious 
relation, as in dim, unconscious relation he is already united, 
with the whole future and the whole past.&rsquo;</p>
<p>To keep the past alive for us is the pious function of the 
historian.&nbsp; Our curiosity is endless, his the task of 
gratifying it.&nbsp; We want to know what happened long 
ago.&nbsp; Performance of this task is only proximately possible;
but none the less it must be attempted, for the demand for it is 
born afresh with every infant&rsquo;s cry.&nbsp; History is a 
pageant, and not a philosophy.</p>
<p>Poets, no less than professors, occasionally say good things 
even in prose, and the following oracular utterance of Shelley is
not pure nonsense:&mdash;&lsquo;History is the cyclic poem 
written by Time upon the memories of men.&nbsp; The past, like an
inspired rhapsodist, fills the theatre of everlasting generations
with her harmony.&rsquo;</p>
<p>If this be thought a little too fanciful, let me adorn these 
pages with a passage from one of the great masters of English 
prose&mdash;Walter <!-- page 185--><a name="page185"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 185</span>Savage Landor.&nbsp; Would that the 
pious labour of transcription could confer the tiniest measure of
the gift!&nbsp; In that bundle of imaginary letters Landor called
<i>Pericles and Aspasia</i>, we find Aspasia writing to her 
friend Cleone as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;To-day there came to visit us a writer who 
is not yet an author; his name is Thucydides.&nbsp; We understand
that he has been these several years engaged in preparation for a
history.&nbsp; Pericles invited him to meet Herodotus, when that 
wonderful man had returned to our country, and was about to sail 
from Athens.&nbsp; Until then it was believed by the intimate 
friends of Thucydides that he would devote his life to poetry, 
and, such is his vigour both of thought and expression, that he 
would have been the rival of Pindar.&nbsp; Even now he is fonder 
of talking on poetry than any other subject, and blushed when 
history was mentioned.&nbsp; By degrees, however, he warmed, and 
listened with deep interest to the discourse of Pericles on the 
duties of a historian.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;May our first Athenian historian not be the 
greatest,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;as the first of our dramatists 
has been, in the opinion of many.&nbsp; We are growing too 
loquacious, both on the <!-- page 186--><a 
name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>stage and 
off.&nbsp; We make disquisitions which render us only more and 
more dim-sighted, and excursions that only consume our 
stores.&nbsp; If some among us who have acquired celebrity by 
their compositions, calm, candid, contemplative men, were to 
undertake the history of Athens from the invasion of Xerxes, I 
should expect a fair and full criticism on the orations of 
Antiphon, and experience no disappointment at their forgetting 
the battle of Salamis.&nbsp; History, when she has lost her Muse,
will lose her dignity, her occupation, her character, her 
name.&nbsp; She will wander about the Agora; she will start, she 
will stop, she will look wild, she will look stupid, she will 
take languidly to her bosom doubts, queries, essays, 
dissertations, some of which ought to go before her, some to 
follow, and all to stand apart.&nbsp; The field of history should
not merely be well tilled, but well peopled.&nbsp; None is 
delightful to me or interesting in which I find not as many 
illustrious names as have a right to enter it.&nbsp; We might as 
well in a drama place the actors behind the scenes, and listen to
the dialogue there, as in a history push valiant men back and 
protrude ourselves with <!-- page 187--><a 
name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>husky 
disputations.&nbsp; Show me rather how great projects were 
executed, great advantages gained, and great calamities 
averted.&nbsp; Show me the generals and the statesmen who stood 
foremost, that I may bend to them in reverence; tell me their 
names, that I may repeat them to my children.&nbsp; Teach me 
whence laws were introduced, upon what foundation laid, by what 
custody guarded, in what inner keep preserved.&nbsp; Let the 
books of the treasury lie closed as religiously as the 
Sibyl&rsquo;s; leave weights and measures in the market-place, 
Commerce in the harbour, the Arts in the light they love, 
Philosophy in the shade; place History on her rightful throne, 
and at the sides of her Eloquence and War.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is, doubtless, a somewhat full-dress view of 
history.&nbsp; Landor was not one of our modern 
dressing-gown-and-slippers kind of authors.&nbsp; He always took 
pains to be splendid, and preferred stately magnificence to 
chatty familiarity.&nbsp; But, after allowing for this, is not 
the passage I have quoted infused with a great deal of the true 
spirit which should animate the historian, and does it not seem 
to take us by the hand and lead us very far away from Professor 
Seeley&rsquo;s <!-- page 188--><a name="page188"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 188</span>maxims and morals, his theoretical 
studies, his political philosophy, his political economy, and his
desire to break the drowsy spell of narrative, and to set us all 
problems?&nbsp; I ask this question in no spirit of enmity 
towards these theoretical studies, nor do I doubt for one moment 
that the student of history proper, who has a turn in their 
directions, will find his pursuit made only the more fascinating 
the more he studies them&mdash;just as a little botany is said to
add to the charm of a country walk; but&mdash;and surely the 
assertion is not necessarily paradoxical&mdash;these studies 
ought not to be allowed to disfigure the free-flowing outline of 
the historical Muse, or to thicken her clear utterance, which in 
her higher moods chants an epic, and in her ordinary moods 
recites a narrative which need not be drowsy.</p>
<p>As for maxims, we all of us have our &lsquo;little hoard of 
maxims&rsquo; wherewith to preach down our hearts and justify 
anything shabby we may have done; but the less we import their 
cheap wisdom into history the better.&nbsp; The author of the 
<i>Expansion of England</i> will probably agree with Burke in 
thinking that &lsquo;a great empire and little minds go ill 
together,&rsquo; and so, surely, <i>&agrave; fortiori</i>, must a
mighty universe and any possible <!-- page 189--><a 
name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
189</span>maxim.&nbsp; There have been plenty of brave historical
maxims before Professor Seeley&rsquo;s, though only Lord 
Bolingbroke&rsquo;s has had the good luck to become itself 
historical. <a name="citation189"></a><a href="#footnote189" 
class="citation">[189]</a>&nbsp; And as for theories, Professor 
Flint, a very learned writer, has been at the pains to enumerate 
fourteen French and thirteen German philosophies of history 
current (though some, I expect, never ran either fast or far) 
since the revival of learning.</p>
<p>We are (are we not?) in these days in no little danger of 
being philosophy-ridden, and of losing our love for facts simply 
as facts.&nbsp; So long as Carlyle lived the concrete had a 
representative, the strength of whose epithets sufficed, if not 
to keep the philosophers in awe, at least to supply their 
opponents with stones.&nbsp; But now it is different.&nbsp; 
Carlyle is no more a model historian than is Shakspeare a model 
dramatist.&nbsp; The merest tyro can count the faults of either 
on his clumsy fingers.&nbsp; That born critic, the late Sir 
George Lewis, had barely completed his tenth year before he was 
able, in a letter to his <!-- page 190--><a 
name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>mother, to 
point out to her the essentially faulty structure of 
<i>Hamlet</i>, and many a duller wit, a decade or two later in 
his existence, has come to the conclusion that <i>Frederick the 
Great</i> is far too long.&nbsp; But whatever were 
Carlyle&rsquo;s faults, his historical method was superbly 
naturalistic.&nbsp; Have we a historian left us so honestly 
possessed as he was with the genuine historical instinct, the 
true enthusiasm to know what happened; or one half so fond of a 
story for its own sake, or so in love with things, not for what 
they were, but simply because they were?&nbsp; &lsquo;What 
wonderful things are events!&rsquo; wrote Lord Beaconsfield in 
<i>Coningsby</i>; &lsquo;the least are of greater importance than
the most sublime and comprehensive speculations.&rsquo;&nbsp; To 
say this is to go perhaps too far; certainly it is to go farther 
than Carlyle, who none the less was in sympathy with the remark; 
for he also worshipped events, believing as he did that but for 
the breath of God&rsquo;s mouth they never would have been events
at all.&nbsp; We thus find him always treating even comparatively
insignificant facts with a measure of reverence, and handling 
them lovingly, as does a book-hunter the shabbiest pamphlet in 
his collection.&nbsp; We have only to think of Carlyle&rsquo;s 
essay on the <i>Diamond Necklace</i> to fill <!-- page 191--><a 
name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>our minds 
with his qualifications for the proud office of the 
historian.&nbsp; Were that inimitable piece of workmanship to be 
submitted to the criticisms of the new scientific school, we 
doubt whether it would be so much as classed, whilst the 
celebrated description of the night before the battle of Dunbar 
in <i>Cromwell</i>, or any hundred scenes from the <i>French 
Revolution</i>, would, we expect, be catalogued as good examples 
of that degrading process whereby history fades into mere 
literature.</p>
<p>This is not a question, be it observed, of style.&nbsp; What 
is called a picturesque style is generally a great trial.&nbsp; 
Who was it who called Professor Masson&rsquo;s style Carlyle on 
wooden legs?&nbsp; What can be drearier than when a plain 
matter-of-fact writer attempts to be animated, and tries to make 
his characters live by the easy but futile expedient of writing 
about them in the present tense?&nbsp; What is wanted is a 
passion for facts; the style may be left to take care of 
itself.&nbsp; Let me name a historian who detested fine writing, 
and who never said to himself, &lsquo;Go to, I will make a 
description,&rsquo; and who yet was dominated by a love for 
facts, whose one desire always was to know what happened, to 
dispel illusion, and establish the true account&mdash;Dr. S. R. 
Maitland, <!-- page 192--><a name="page192"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 192</span>of the Lambeth Library, whose 
volumes entitled <i>The Dark Ages</i> and <i>The Reformation</i> 
are to history what Milton&rsquo;s <i>Lycidas</i> is said to be 
to poetry: if they do not interest you, your tastes are not 
historical.</p>
<p>The difference, we repeat, is not of style, but of aim.&nbsp; 
Is history a pageant or a philosophy?&nbsp; That eminent 
historian, Lord Macaulay, whose passion for letters and for 
&lsquo;mere literature&rsquo; ennobled his whole life, has 
expressed himself in some places, I need scarcely add in a most 
forcible manner, in the same sense as Mr. Morley.&nbsp; In his 
well-known essay on history, contributed to the <i>Edinburgh 
Review</i> in 1828, we find him writing as follows: &lsquo;Facts 
are the mere dross of history.&nbsp; It is from the abstract 
truth which interpenetrates them, and lies latent amongst them 
like gold in the ore, that the mass derives its whole 
value.&rsquo;&nbsp; And again: &lsquo;No past event has any 
intrinsic importance.&nbsp; The knowledge of it is valuable only 
as it leads us to form just calculations with respect to the 
future.&rsquo;&nbsp; These are strong passages; but Lord Macaulay
was a royal eclectic, and was quite out of sympathy with the 
majority of that brotherhood who are content to tone down their 
contradictories to the dull level of ineptitudes.&nbsp; <!-- page
193--><a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
193</span>Macaulay never toned down his contradictories, but, 
heightening everything all round, went on his sublime way, 
rejoicing like a strong man to run a race, and well knowing that 
he could give anybody five yards in fifty and win easily.&nbsp; 
It is, therefore, no surprise to find him, in the very essay in 
which he speaks so contemptuously of facts, laying on with his 
vigorous brush a celebrated purple patch I would gladly transfer 
to my own dull page were it not too long and too well 
known.&nbsp; A line or two taken at random will give its 
purport:</p>
<p>&lsquo;A truly great historian would reclaim those materials 
the novelist has appropriated.&nbsp; We should not then have to 
look for the wars and votes of the Puritans in Clarendon and for 
their phraseology in <i>Old Mortality</i>, for one half of King 
James in Hume and for the other half in the <i>Fortunes of 
Nigel</i>. . . . Society would be shown from the highest to the 
lowest, from the royal cloth of state to the den of the outlaw, 
from the throne of the legate to the chimney-corner where the 
begging friar regaled himself.&nbsp; Palmers, minstrels, 
crusaders, the stately monastery with the good cheer in its 
refectory, and the tournament with the heralds and ladies, the 
trumpets and the cloth of gold, would give <!-- page 194--><a 
name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>truth and 
life to the representation.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is difficult to see 
what abstract truth interpenetrates the cheer of the refectory, 
or what just calculations with respect to the future even an 
upholsterer could draw from a cloth, either of state or of gold; 
whilst most people will admit that, when the brilliant essayist a
few years later set himself to compose his own magnificent 
history, so far as he interpenetrated it with the abstract truths
of Whiggism, and calculated that the future would be satisfied 
with the first Reform Bill, he did ill and guessed wrong.</p>
<p>To reconcile Macaulay&rsquo;s utterances on this subject is 
beyond my powers, but of two things I am satisfied: the first is 
that, were he to come to life again, a good many of us would be 
more careful than we are how we write about him; and the second 
is that, on the happening of the same event, he would be found 
protesting against the threatened domination of all things by 
scientific theory.&nbsp; A Western American, who was once 
compelled to spend some days in Boston, was accustomed in 
after-life to describe that seat of polite learning to his 
horrified companions in California as a city in whose streets 
Respectability stalked unchecked.&nbsp; This is just what 
philosophical theories are doing amongst <!-- page 195--><a 
name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>us, and a 
decent person can hardly venture abroad without one, though it 
does not much matter which one.&nbsp; Everybody is expected to 
have &lsquo;a system of philosophy with principles coherent, 
interdependent, subordinate, and derivative,&rsquo; and to be 
able to account for everything, even for things it used not to be
thought sensible to believe in, like ghosts and haunted 
houses.&nbsp; Keats remarks in one of his letters with great 
admiration upon what he christens Shakspeare&rsquo;s 
&lsquo;negative capability,&rsquo; meaning thereby 
Shakspeare&rsquo;s habit of complaisant observation from outside 
of theory, and his keen enjoyment of the unexplained facts of 
life.&nbsp; He did not pour himself out in every strife.&nbsp; We
have but little of this negative capability.&nbsp; The ruddy 
qualities of delightfulness, of pleasantness, are all 
&lsquo;sicklied o&rsquo;er with the pale cast of 
thought.&rsquo;&nbsp; The varied elements of life&mdash;the</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Murmur of living,<br />
Stir of existence,<br />
Soul of the world!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>seem to be fading from literature.&nbsp; Pure literary 
enthusiasm sheds but few rays.&nbsp; To be lively is to be 
flippant, and epigram is dubbed paradox.</p>
<p><!-- page 196--><a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
196</span>That many people appear to like a drab-coloured world 
hung round with dusky shreds of philosophy is sufficiently 
obvious.&nbsp; These persons find any relaxation they may require
from a too severe course of theories, religious, political, 
social, or now, alas! historical, in the novels of Mr. W. D. 
Howells, an American gentleman who has not been allowed to forget
that he once asserted of fiction what Professor Seeley would be 
glad to be able to assert of history, that the drowsy spell of 
narrative has been broken.&nbsp; We are to look for no more Sir 
Walters, no more Thackerays, no more Dickens.&nbsp; The stories 
have all been told.&nbsp; Plots are exploded.&nbsp; Incident is 
over.&nbsp; In moods of dejection these dark sayings seemed only 
too true.&nbsp; Shakspeare&rsquo;s saddest of sad lines rose to 
one&rsquo;s lips:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;My grief lies onward and my joy 
behind.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Behind us are <i>Ivanhoe</i> and <i>Guy Mannering</i>, 
<i>Pendennis</i> and <i>The Virginians</i>, Pecksniff and 
Micawber.&nbsp; In front of us stretch a never-ending series, a 
dreary vista of <i>Foregone Conclusions</i>, <i>Counterfeit 
Presentments</i>, and <i>Undiscovered Countries</i>.&nbsp; But 
the darkest watch of the night is the one before the dawn, and 
relief is often <!-- page 197--><a name="page197"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 197</span>nearest us when we least expect 
it.&nbsp; All this gloomy nonsense was suddenly dispelled, and 
the fact that really and truly, and behind this philosophical 
arras, we were all inwardly ravening for stories was most 
satisfactorily established by the incontinent manner in which we 
flung ourselves into the arms of Mr. Robert Louis Stevenson, to 
whom we could almost have raised a statue in the market-place for
having written <i>Treasure Island</i>.</p>
<p>But to return to history.&nbsp; The interests of our poor 
human life, which seems to become duller every day, require that 
the fields of history should be kept for ever unenclosed, and be 
a free breathing-place for a pallid population well-nigh stifled 
with the fumes of philosophy.</p>
<p>Were we, imaginatively, to propel ourselves forward to the 
middle of the next century, and to fancy a well-equipped 
historian armed with the digested learning of Gibbon, endowed 
with the eye of Carlyle, and say one-fifteenth of his humour 
(even then a dangerous allotment in a dull world), the moral 
gravity of Dr. Arnold, the critical sympathy of Sainte-Beuve, and
the style of Dr. Newman, approaching the period through which we 
have lived, should we desire this <!-- page 198--><a 
name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>talented 
mortal to encumber himself with a theory into which to thrust all
our doings as we toss clothes into a portmanteau; to set himself 
to extract the essence of some new political philosophy, capable 
of being applied to the practical politics of his own day, or to 
busy himself with problems or economics?&nbsp; To us personally, 
of course, it is a matter of indifference how the historians of 
the twentieth century conduct themselves; but ought not our 
altruism to bear the strain of a hope that at least one of the 
band may avoid all these things, and, leaving political 
philosophy to the political philosopher and political economy to 
the political economist, remember that the first, if not the 
last, duty of the historian is to narrate, to supply the text not
the comment, the subject not the sermon, and proceed to tell our 
grandchildren and remoter issue the story of our lives?&nbsp; The
clash of arms will resound through his pages as musically as ever
it does through those of the elder historians as he tells of the 
encounter between the Northern and Southern States of America, in
which Right and Might, those great twin-brethren, fought side by 
side; but Romance, that ancient parasite, clung affectionately 
with her tendril-hands to the mouldering walls of an ancient 
wrong, <!-- page 199--><a name="page199"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 199</span>thus enabling the historian, whilst 
awarding the victor&rsquo;s palm to General Grant, to write 
kindly of the lost cause, dear to the heart of a nobler and more 
chivalrous man, General Lee, of the Virginian army.&nbsp; And 
again, is it not almost possible to envy the historian to whom 
will belong the task of writing with full information, and all 
the advantage of the true historic distance, the history of that 
series of struggles and heroisms, of plots and counter-plots, of 
crimes and counter-crimes, resulting in the freedom of Italy, and
of telling to a world, eager to listen, the life-story of Joseph 
Mazzini?</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Of God nor man was ever this thing said,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; That he could give<br />
Life back to her who gave him, whence his dead<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Mother might live.<br />
But this man found his mother dead and slain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With fast sealed eyes,<br />
And bade the dead rise up and live again,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And she did rise.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nor will our imaginary historian be unmindful of Cavour, or 
fail to thrill his readers by telling them how, when the great 
Italian statesman, with many sins upon his conscience, lay in the
very grasp of death, he interrupted the priests, busy at their 
work of intercession, almost <!-- page 200--><a 
name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>roughly, 
with the exclamation, &lsquo;Pray not for me.&rsquo;&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Pray for Italy!&rsquo; whilst if he be one who has a turn 
for that ironical pastime, the dissection of a king, the curious 
character, and muddle of motives, calling itself Carlo Alberto, 
will afford him material for at least two paragraphs of subtle 
interest.&nbsp; Lastly, if our historian is ambitious of a larger
canvas and of deeper colours, what is there to prevent him, 
bracing himself to the task,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;As when some mighty 
painter dips<br />
His pencil in the hues of earthquake and eclipse,&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>from writing the epitaph of the Napoleonic legend?</p>
<p>But all this time I hear Professor Seeley whispering in my 
ear, &lsquo;What is this but the old literary groove leading to 
no trustworthy knowledge?&rsquo;&nbsp; If by trustworthy 
knowledge is meant demonstrable conclusions, capable of being 
expressed in terms at once exact and final, trustworthy knowledge
is not to be gained from the witness of history, whose testimony 
none the less must be received, weighed, and taken into 
account.&nbsp; Truly observes Carlyle: &lsquo;If history is 
philosophy teaching by examples, the writer fitted to compose 
history is hitherto an <!-- page 201--><a 
name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>unknown 
man.&nbsp; Better were it that mere earthly historians should 
lower such pretensions, and, aiming only at some picture of the 
thing acted, which picture itself will be but a poor 
approximation, leave the inscrutable purport of them an 
acknowledged secret.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Some picture of the 
thing acted.&rsquo;&nbsp; Here we behold the task of the 
historian; nor is it an idle, fruitless task.&nbsp; Science is 
not the only, or the chief source of knowledge.&nbsp; The 
<i>Iliad</i>, Shakspeare&rsquo;s plays, have taught the world 
more than the <i>Politics</i> of Aristotle or the <i>Novum 
Organum</i> of Bacon.</p>
<p>Facts are not the dross of history, but the true metal, and 
the historian is a worker in that metal.&nbsp; He has nothing to 
do with abstract truth, or with practical politics, or with 
forecasts of the future.&nbsp; A worker in metal he is, and has 
certainly plenty of what Lord Bacon used to call 
&lsquo;stuff&rsquo; to work upon; but if he is to be a great 
historian, and not a mere chronicler, he must be an artist as 
well as an artisan, and have something of the spirit which 
animated such a man as Francesco Francia of Bologna, now only 
famous as a painter, but in his own day equally celebrated as a 
worker in gold, and whose practice it was to sign his pictures 
with the word Goldsmith <!-- page 202--><a 
name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>after his 
name, whilst he engraved Painter on his golden crucifixes.</p>
<p>The true historian, therefore, seeking to compose a true 
picture of the thing acted, must collect facts, select facts, and
combine facts.&nbsp; Methods will differ, styles will 
differ.&nbsp; Nobody ever does anything exactly like anybody 
else; but the end in view is generally the same, and the 
historian&rsquo;s end is truthful narration.&nbsp; Maxims he will
have, if he is wise, never a one; and as for a moral, if he tell 
his story well, it will need none; if he tell it ill, it will 
deserve none.</p>
<p>The stream of narrative flowing swiftly, as it does, over the 
jagged rocks of human destiny, must often be turbulent and 
tossed; it is, therefore, all the more the duty of every good 
citizen to keep it as undefiled as possible, and to do what in 
him lies to prevent peripatetic philosophers on the banks from 
throwing their theories into it, either dead ones to decay, or 
living ones to drown.&nbsp; Let the philosophers ventilate their 
theories, construct their blow-holes, extract their essences, 
discuss their maxims, and point their morals as much as they 
will; but let them do so apart.&nbsp; History must not lose her 
Muse, or &lsquo;take to her bosom doubts, queries, essays, 
dissertations, <!-- page 203--><a name="page203"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 203</span>some of which ought to go before 
her, some to follow, and all to stand apart.&rsquo;&nbsp; Let us 
at all events secure our narrative first&mdash;sermons and 
philosophy the day after.</p>
<h2><!-- page 204--><a name="page204"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 204</span>CHARLES LAMB. <a 
name="citation204"></a><a href="#footnote204" 
class="citation">[204]</a></h2>
<p>Mr. Walter Bagehot preferred Hazlitt to Lamb, reckoning the 
former much the greater writer.&nbsp; The preferences of such a 
man as Bagehot are not to be lightly disregarded, least of all 
when their sincerity is vouched for, as in the present case, by 
half a hundred quotations from the favoured author.&nbsp; 
Certainly no writer repays a literary man&rsquo;s devotion better
than Hazlitt, of whose twenty seldom read volumes hardly a page 
but glitters with quotable matter; the true ore, to be had for 
the cost of cartage.&nbsp; You may live like a gentleman for a 
twelvemonth on Hazlitt&rsquo;s ideas.&nbsp; Opinions, no doubt, 
differ as to how many quotations a writer is entitled to; but, 
for my part, I like to see an author leap-frog into his subject 
over the back of a brother.</p>
<p><!-- page 205--><a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
205</span>I do not remember whether Bagehot has anywhere given 
his reasons for his preference&mdash;the open avowal whereof 
drove Crabb Robinson well-nigh distracted; and it is always rash 
to find reasons for a faith you do not share; but probably they 
partook of the nature of a complaint that Elia&rsquo;s treatment 
of men and things (meaning by things, books) is often 
fantastical, unreal, even a shade insincere; whilst Hazlitt 
always at least aims at the centre, whether he hits it or 
not.&nbsp; Lamb dances round a subject; Hazlitt grapples with 
it.&nbsp; So far as Hazlitt is concerned, doubtless this is so; 
his literary method seems to realize the agreeable aspiration of 
Mr. Browning&rsquo;s <i>Italian in England</i>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I would grasp Metternich until<br />
I felt his wet red throat distil<br />
In blood thro&rsquo; these two hands.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hazlitt is always grasping some Metternich.&nbsp; He said 
himself that Lamb&rsquo;s talk was like snap-dragon, and his own 
not very much &lsquo;unlike a game of nine-pins.&rsquo;&nbsp; 
Lamb, writing to him on one occasion about his son, wishes the 
little fellow a &lsquo;smoother head of hair and somewhat of a 
better temper than his father;&rsquo; and the pleasant words seem
to call back from the past the stormy figure of the man who loved
<!-- page 206--><a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
206</span>art, literature, and the drama with a consuming 
passion, who has described books and plays, authors and actors, 
with a fiery enthusiasm and reality quite unsurpassable, and who 
yet, neither living nor dead, has received his due meed of 
praise.&nbsp; Men still continue to hold aloof from Hazlitt; his 
shaggy head and fierce scowling temper still seem to terrorize; 
and his very books, telling us though they do about all things 
most delightful&mdash;poems, pictures, and the cheerful 
playhouse&mdash;frown upon us from their upper shelf.&nbsp; From 
this it appears that would a genius ensure for himself 
immortality, he must brush his hair and keep his temper; but, 
alas! how seldom can he be persuaded to do either.&nbsp; Charles 
Lamb did both; and the years as they roll do but swell the rich 
revenues of his praise.&nbsp; Lamb&rsquo;s popularity shows no 
sign of waning.&nbsp; Even that most extraordinary compound, the 
rising generation of readers, whose taste in literature is as 
erratic as it is pronounced; who have never heard of James 
Thomson who sang <i>The Seasons</i> (including the pleasant 
episode of Musidora bathing), but understand by any reference to 
that name only the striking author of <i>The City of Dreadful 
Night</i>; even these wayward folk&mdash;the dogs of whose 
criticism, not yet full <!-- page 207--><a 
name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span>grown, 
will, when let loose, as some day they must be, cry 
&lsquo;havoc&rsquo; amongst established reputations&mdash;read 
their Lamb, letters as well as essays, with laughter and with 
love.</p>
<p>If it be really seriously urged against Lamb as an author that
he is fantastical and artistically artificial, it must be owned 
he is so.&nbsp; His humour, exquisite as it is, is modish.&nbsp; 
It may not be for all markets.&nbsp; How it affected the Scottish
Thersites we know only too well&mdash;that dour spirit required 
more potent draughts to make him forget his misery and 
laugh.&nbsp; It took Swift or Smollett to move his mirth, which 
was always, three parts of it, derision.&nbsp; Lamb&rsquo;s 
elaborateness, what he himself calls his affected array of 
antique modes and phrases, is sometimes overlooked in these 
strange days, when it is thought better to read about an author 
than to read him.&nbsp; To read aloud the <i>Praise of Chimney 
Sweepers</i> without stumbling, or halting, not to say 
mispronouncing, and to set in motion every one of its 
carefully-swung sentences, is a very pretty feat in elocution, 
for there is not what can be called a natural sentence in it from
beginning to end.&nbsp; Many people have not patience for this 
sort of thing; they like to laugh and move on.&nbsp; Other 
people, again, like <!-- page 208--><a name="page208"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 208</span>an essay to be about something 
really important, and to conduct them to conclusions they deem 
worth carrying away.&nbsp; Lamb&rsquo;s views about 
indiscriminate almsgiving, so far as these can be extracted from 
his paper <i>On the Decay of Beggars in the Metropolis</i>, are 
unsound, whilst there are at least three ladies still living (in 
Brighton) quite respectably on their means, who consider the 
essay entitled <i>A Bachelor&rsquo;s Complaint of the Behaviour 
of Married People</i> improper.&nbsp; But, as a rule, 
Lamb&rsquo;s essays are neither unsound nor improper; none the 
less they are, in the judgment of some, things of 
naught&mdash;not only lacking, as Southey complained they did, 
&lsquo;sound religious feeling,&rsquo; but everything else really
worthy of attention.</p>
<p>To discuss such congenital differences of taste is idle; but 
it is not idle to observe that when Lamb is read, as he surely 
deserves to be, as a whole&mdash;letters and poems no less than 
essays&mdash;these notes of fantasy and artificiality no longer 
dominate.&nbsp; The man Charles Lamb was far more real, far more 
serious, despite his jesting, more self-contained and 
self-restrained, than Hazlitt, who wasted his life in the pursuit
of the veriest will-o&rsquo;-the-wisps that ever danced over the 
most miasmatic of swamps, who was <!-- page 209--><a 
name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>never his 
own man, and who died, like Brian de Bois Gilbert, &lsquo;the 
victim of contending passions.&rsquo;&nbsp; It should never be 
forgotten that Lamb&rsquo;s vocation was his life.&nbsp; 
Literature was but his byplay, his avocation in the true sense of
that much-abused word.&nbsp; He was not a fisherman, but an 
angler in the lake of letters; an author by chance and on the 
sly.&nbsp; He had a right to disport himself on paper, to play 
the frolic with his own fancies, to give the decalogue the slip, 
whose life was made up of the sternest stuff, of self-sacrifice, 
devotion, honesty, and good sense.</p>
<p>Lamb&rsquo;s letters from first to last are full of the 
philosophy of life; he was as sensible a man as Dr. 
Johnson.&nbsp; One grows sick of the expressions, &lsquo;poor 
Charles Lamb,&rsquo; &lsquo;gentle Charles &lsquo;Lamb,&rsquo; as
if he were one of those grown-up children of the Leigh Hunt type,
who are perpetually begging and borrowing through the round of 
every man&rsquo;s acquaintance.&nbsp; Charles Lamb earned his own
living, paid his own way, was the helper, not the helped; a man 
who was beholden to no one, who always came with gifts in his 
hand, a shrewd man, capable of advice, strong in council.&nbsp; 
Poor Lamb, indeed!&nbsp; Poor Coleridge, robbed of his will; poor
Wordsworth, devoured by his own <i>ego</i>; poor Southey, writing
<!-- page 210--><a name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
210</span>his tomes and deeming himself a classic; poor Carlyle, 
with his nine volumes of memoirs, where he</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Lies like a hedgehog rolled up the wrong 
way,<br />
Tormenting himself with his prickles&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>call these men poor, if you feel it decent to do so, but not 
Lamb, who was rich in all that makes life valuable or memory 
sweet.&nbsp; But he used to get drunk.&nbsp; This explains 
all.&nbsp; Be untruthful, unfaithful, unkind; darken the lives of
all who have to live under your shadow, rob youth of joy, take 
peace from age, live unsought for, die unmourned&mdash;and 
remaining sober you will escape the curse of men&rsquo;s pity, 
and be spoken of as a worthy person.&nbsp; But if ever, amidst 
what Burns called &lsquo;social noise,&rsquo; you so far forget 
yourself as to get drunk, think not to plead a spotless life 
spent with those for whom you have laboured and saved; talk not 
of the love of friends or of help given to the needy; least of 
all make reference to a noble self-sacrifice passing the love of 
women, for all will avail you nothing.&nbsp; You get 
drunk&mdash;and the heartless and the selfish and the lewd crave 
the privilege of pitying you, and receiving your name with an 
odious smile.&nbsp; It is really too bad.</p>
<p><!-- page 211--><a name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
211</span>The completion of Mr. Ainger&rsquo;s edition of 
Lamb&rsquo;s works deserves a word of commemoration.&nbsp; In our
judgment it is all an edition of Lamb&rsquo;s works should 
be.&nbsp; Upon the vexed question, nowadays so much agitated, 
whether an editor is to be allowed any discretion in the 
exclusion from his edition of the rinsings of his author&rsquo;s 
desk, we side with Mr. Ainger, and think more nobly of the editor
than to deny him such a discretion.&nbsp; An editor is not a 
sweep, and, by the love he bears the author whose fame he seeks 
to spread abroad, it is his duty to exclude what he believes does
not bear the due impress of the author&rsquo;s mind.&nbsp; No 
doubt as a rule editors have no discretion to be trusted; but 
happily Mr. Ainger has plenty, and most sincerely do we thank him
for withholding from us <i>A Vision of Horns</i> and <i>The 
Pawnbroker&rsquo;s Daughter</i>.&nbsp; Boldly to assert, as some 
are found to do, that the editor of a master of style has no 
choice but to reprint the scraps or notelets that a misdirected 
energy may succeed in disinterring from the grave the writer had 
dug for them, is to fail to grasp the distinction between a 
collector of <i>curios</i> and a lover of books.&nbsp; But this 
policy of exclusion is no doubt a perilous one.&nbsp; Like the 
Irish <!-- page 212--><a name="page212"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 212</span>members, or Mark Antony&rsquo;s 
wife&mdash;the &lsquo;shrill-toned Fulvia&rsquo;&mdash;the 
missing essays are &lsquo;good, being gone.&rsquo;&nbsp; Surely, 
so we are inclined to grumble, the taste was severe that led Mr. 
Ainger to dismiss <i>Juke Judkins</i>.&nbsp; We are not, indeed, 
prepared to say that Judkins has been wrongfully dismissed, or 
that he has any right of action against Mr. Ainger, but we could 
have put up better with his presence than his absence.</p>
<p>Mr. Ainger&rsquo;s introduction to the <i>Essays of Elia</i> 
is admirable; here is a bit of it:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Another feature of Lamb&rsquo;s style is 
its allusiveness.&nbsp; He is rich in quotations, and in my notes
I have succeeded in tracing most of them to their source, a 
matter of some difficulty in Lamb&rsquo;s case, for his 
inaccuracy is all but perverse.&nbsp; But besides those avowedly 
introduced as such, his style is full of quotations held, if the 
expression may be allowed, in solution.&nbsp; One feels, rather 
than recognises, that a phrase or idiom or turn of expression is 
an echo of something that one has heard or read before.&nbsp; Yet
such is the use made of the material, that a charm is added by 
the very fact that we are thus continually renewing our 
experience of an older day.&nbsp; This style <!-- page 213--><a 
name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 213</span>becomes 
aromatic, like the perfume of faded rose-leaves in a china 
jar.&nbsp; With such allusiveness as this I need not say that I 
have not meddled in my notes; its whole charm lies in recognising
it for ourselves.&nbsp; The &ldquo;prosperity&rdquo; of an 
allusion, as of a jest, &ldquo;lies in the ear of him that hears 
it,&rdquo; and it were doing a poor service to Lamb or his 
readers to draw out and arrange in order the threads he has 
wrought into the very fabric of his English.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then Mr. Ainger&rsquo;s notes are not meddlesome notes, but 
truly explanatory ones, genuine aids to enjoyment.&nbsp; Lamb 
needs notes, and yet the task of adding them to a structure so 
fine and of such nicely studied proportions is a difficult one; 
it is like building a tool-house against La Sainte 
Chapelle.&nbsp; Deftly has Mr. Ainger inserted his notes, and 
capital reading do they make; they tell us all we ought to want 
to know.&nbsp; He is no true lover of Elia who does not care to 
know who the &lsquo;Distant Correspondent&rsquo; was.&nbsp; And 
Barbara S---.&nbsp; &lsquo;It was not much that Barbara had to 
claim.&rsquo;&nbsp; No, dear child! it was not&mdash;&lsquo;a 
bare half-guinea&rsquo;; but you are surely also entitled to be 
known to us by your real name.&nbsp; When Lamb tells us 
Barbara&rsquo;s maiden name was <!-- page 214--><a 
name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 214</span>Street, and
that she was three times married&mdash;first to a Mr. Dancer, 
then to a Mr. Barry, and finally to a Mr. Crawford, whose widow 
she was when he first knew her&mdash;he is telling us things that
were not, for the true Barbara died a spinster, and was born a 
Kelly.</p>
<p>Mr. Ainger, as was to be expected, has a full, instructive 
note anent the Old Benchers of the Inner Temple.&nbsp; Some hasty
editors, with a sorrowfully large experience of Lamb&rsquo;s 
unblushing fictions and Defoe-like falsehoods, and who, perhaps, 
have wasted good hours trying to find out all about Miss 
Barbara&rsquo;s third husband, have sometimes assumed that at all
events most of the names mentioned by Lamb in his immortal essay 
on the Benchers are fictitious.&nbsp; Mr. Ainger, however, 
assures us that the fact is otherwise.&nbsp; Jekyl, Coventry, 
Pierson, Parton, Read, Wharry, Jackson, and Mingay, no less than 
&lsquo;unruffled Samuel Salt,&rsquo; were all real persons, and 
were called to the Bench of the Honourable Society by those very 
names.&nbsp; One mistake, indeed, Lamb makes&mdash;he writes of 
Mr. Twopenny as if he had been a Bencher.&nbsp; Now, there never 
yet was a Bencher of the name of Twopenny; though the mistake is 
easily accounted for.&nbsp; There was a Mr. Twopenny, <!-- page 
215--><a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 215</span>a 
very thin man too, just as Lamb described him, who lived in the 
Temple; but he was not a Bencher, he was not even a barrister; he
was a much better thing, namely, stockbroker to the Bank of 
England.&nbsp; The holding of this office, which Mr. Ainger 
rightly calls important, doubtless accounts for Twopenny&rsquo;s 
constant good-humour and felicitous jesting about his own 
person.&nbsp; A man who has a snug berth other people want feels 
free to crack such jokes.</p>
<p>Of the contents of these three volumes we can say deliberately
what Dr. Johnson said, surely in his haste, of Baxter&rsquo;s 
three hundred works, &lsquo;Read them all, they are all 
good.&rsquo;&nbsp; Do not be content with the essays alone.&nbsp;
It is shabby treatment of an author who has given you pleasure to
leave him half unread; it is nearly as bad as keeping a friend 
waiting.&nbsp; Anyhow, read <i>Mrs. Leicester&rsquo;s School</i>;
it is nearly all Mary Lamb&rsquo;s, but the more you like it on 
that account the better pleased her brother would have been.</p>
<p>We are especially glad to notice that Mr. Ainger holds us out 
hopes of an edition, uniform with the works, of the letters of 
Charles Lamb.&nbsp; Until he has given us these, also with <!-- 
page 216--><a name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
216</span>notes, his pious labours are incomplete.&nbsp; 
Lamb&rsquo;s letters are not only the best text of his life, but 
the best comment upon it.&nbsp; They reveal all the heroism of 
the man and all the cunning of the author; they do the reader 
good by stealth.&nbsp; Let us have them speedily, so that honest 
men may have in their houses a complete edition of at least one 
author of whom they can truthfully say, that they never know 
whether they most admire the writer or love the man.</p>
<h2><!-- page 217--><a name="page217"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 217</span>EMERSON.</h2>
<p>There are men whose charm is in their entirety.&nbsp; Their 
words occasionally utter what their looks invariably 
express.&nbsp; We read their thoughts by the light of their 
smiles.&nbsp; Not to see and hear these men is not to know them, 
and criticism without personal knowledge is in their case 
mutilation.&nbsp; Those who did know them listen in despair to 
the half-hearted praise and clumsy disparagement of critical 
strangers, and are apt to exclaim, as did the younger Pitt, when 
some extraneous person was expressing wonder at the enormous 
reputation of Fox, &lsquo;Ah! you have never been under the wand 
of the magician.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Of such was Ralph Waldo Emerson.&nbsp; When we find so 
cool-brained a critic as Mr. Lowell writing and quoting thus of 
Emerson:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Those who heard him while their natures 
<!-- page 218--><a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
218</span>were yet plastic, and their mental nerves trembled 
under the slightest breath of divine air, will never cease to 
feel and say:</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Was never eye did see that face<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was never ear did hear that tongue,<br />
Was never mind did mind his grace<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That ever thought the travail long;<br />
But eyes, and ears, and every thought<br />
Were with his sweet perfections caught;&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>we recognise at once that the sooner we take off our shoes the
better, for that the ground upon which we are standing is 
holy.&nbsp; How can we sufficiently honour the men who, in this 
secular, work-a-day world, habitually breathe</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;An ampler ether, a diviner air,&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>than ours!</p>
<p>But testimony of this kind, conclusive as it is upon the 
question of Emerson&rsquo;s personal influence, will not always 
be admissible in support of his claims as an author.&nbsp; In the
long-run an author&rsquo;s only witnesses are his own books.</p>
<p>In Dr. Holmes&rsquo;s estimate of Emerson&rsquo;s books 
everyone must wish to concur. <a name="citation218"></a><a 
href="#footnote218" class="citation">[218]</a>&nbsp; These are 
not the days, nor is this dry and thirsty land of ours the place,
when or where we can afford <!-- page 219--><a 
name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 219</span>to pass by 
any well of spiritual influence.&nbsp; It is matter, therefore, 
for rejoicing that, in the opinion of so many good judges, 
Emerson&rsquo;s well can never be choked up.&nbsp; His essays, so
at least we are told by no less a critic than Mr. Arnold, are the
most valuable prose contributions to English literature of the 
century; his letters to Mr. Carlyle carried into all our homes 
the charm of a most delightful personality; the quaint melody of 
his poems abides in many ears.&nbsp; He would, indeed, be a churl
who grudged Emerson his fame.</p>
<p>But when we are considering a writer so full of intelligence 
as Emerson&mdash;one so remote and detached from the 
world&rsquo;s bluster and brag&mdash;it is especially incumbent 
upon us to charge our own language with intelligence, and to make
sure that what we say is at least truth for us.</p>
<p>Were we at liberty to agree with Dr. Holmes in his unmeasured 
praise&mdash;did we, in short, find Emerson full of 
inspiration&mdash;our task would be as easy as it would be 
pleasant; but not entirely agreeing with Dr. Holmes, and somehow 
missing the inspiration, the difficulty we began by mentioning 
presses heavily upon us.</p>
<p>Pleasant reading as the introductory thirty-five <!-- page 
220--><a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
220</span>pages of Dr. Holmes&rsquo;s book make, we doubt the 
wisdom of so very sketchy an account of Emerson&rsquo;s lineage 
and intellectual environment.&nbsp; Attracted towards Emerson 
everybody must be; but there are many who have never been able to
get quit of an uneasy fear as to his &lsquo;staying 
power.&rsquo;&nbsp; He has seemed to some of us a little thin and
vague.&nbsp; A really great author dissipates all such 
fears.&nbsp; Read a page and they are gone.&nbsp; To inquire 
after the intellectual health of such a one would be an 
impertinence.&nbsp; Emerson hardly succeeds in inspiring this 
confidence, but is more like a clever invalid who says, and is 
encouraged by his friends to say, brilliant things, but of whom 
it would be cruel to expect prolonged mental exertion.&nbsp; A 
man, he himself has said, &lsquo;should give us a sense of 
mass.&rsquo;&nbsp; He perhaps does not do so.&nbsp; This gloomy 
and possibly distorted view is fostered rather than discouraged 
by Dr. Holmes&rsquo;s introductory pages about Boston life and 
intellect.&nbsp; It does not seem to have been a very strong 
place.&nbsp; We lack performance.&nbsp; It is of small avail to 
write, as Dr. Holmes does, about &lsquo;brilliant circles,&rsquo;
and &lsquo;literary luminaries,&rsquo; and then to pass on, and 
leave the circles circulating and the luminaries shining <i>in 
vacuo</i>.&nbsp; We want <!-- page 221--><a 
name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 221</span>to know how
they were brilliant, and what they illuminated.&nbsp; If you wish
me to believe that you are witty I must really trouble you to 
make a joke.&nbsp; Dr. Holmes&rsquo;s own wit, for example, is as
certain as the law of gravitation, but over all these pages of 
his hangs vagueness, and we scan them in vain for reassuring 
details.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mild orthodoxy, ripened in Unitarian sunshine,&rsquo; 
does not sound very appetising, though we are assured by Dr. 
Holmes that it is &lsquo;a very agreeable aspect of 
Christianity.&rsquo;&nbsp; Emerson himself does not seem to have 
found it very lively, for in 1832, after three years&rsquo; 
experience of the ministry of the &lsquo;Second Church&rsquo; of 
Boston, he retires from it, not tumultuously or with any deep 
feeling, but with something very like a yawn.&nbsp; He concludes 
his farewell sermon to his people as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Having said this I have said all.&nbsp; I 
have no hostility to this institution. <a 
name="citation221"></a><a href="#footnote221" 
class="citation">[221]</a>&nbsp; I am only stating my want of 
sympathy with it.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr. Holmes makes short work of Emerson&rsquo;s 
childhood.&nbsp; He was born in Boston on the 25th May, 1803, and
used to sit upon a wall and drive his mother&rsquo;s cow to 
pasture.&nbsp; In fact, Dr. Holmes adds nothing to what we 
already <!-- page 222--><a name="page222"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 222</span>knew of the quiet and blameless life
that came to its appointed end on the 27th April, 1882.&nbsp; On 
the completion of his college education, Emerson became a student
of theology, and after a turn at teaching, was ordained, in 
March, 1829, minister of the &lsquo;Second Church&rsquo; in 
Boston.&nbsp; In September of the same year he married; and the 
death of his young wife, in February, 1832, perhaps quickened the
doubts and disinclinations which severed his connection with his 
&lsquo;Church&rsquo; on the 9th September, 1832.&nbsp; The 
following year he visited Europe for the first time, and made his
celebrated call upon Carlyle at Craigenputtock, and laid the keel
of a famous friendship.&nbsp; In the summer of 1834 he settled at
Concord.&nbsp; He married again, visited England again, wrote 
essays, delivered lectures, made orations, published poems, 
carried on a long and most remarkable correspondence with 
Carlyle, enjoyed after the most temperate and serene of fashions 
many things and much happiness.&nbsp; And then he died.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can you emit sparks?&rsquo; said the cat to the ugly 
duckling in the fairy tale, and the poor abashed creature had to 
admit that it could not.&nbsp; Emerson could emit sparks with the
most electrical of cats.&nbsp; He is all sparks and shocks.&nbsp;
<!-- page 223--><a name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
223</span>If one were required to name the most non-sequacious 
author one had ever read, I do not see how one could help 
nominating Emerson.&nbsp; But, say some of his warmest admirers, 
&lsquo;What then?&nbsp; It does not matter!&rsquo;&nbsp; It 
appears to me to matter a great deal.</p>
<p>A wise author never allows his reader&rsquo;s mind to be at 
large, but casts about from the very first how to secure it all 
for himself.&nbsp; He takes you (seemingly) into his confidence, 
perhaps pretends to consult you as to the best route, but at all 
events points out to you the road, lying far ahead, which you are
to travel in his company.&nbsp; How carefully does a really great
writer, like Dr. Newman or M. R&eacute;nan, explain to you what 
he is going to do and how he is going to do it!&nbsp; His humour,
wit, and fancy, however abundant they may be, spring up like 
wayside flowers, and do but adorn and render more attractive the 
path along which it is his object to conduct you.&nbsp; The 
reader&rsquo;s mind, interested from the beginning, and desirous 
of ascertaining whether the author keeps his word and adheres to 
his plan, feels the glow of healthy exercise, and pays a real 
though unconscious attention.&nbsp; But Emerson makes no terms 
with his readers&mdash;he gives them neither <!-- page 224--><a 
name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 224</span>thread nor 
clue, and thus robs them of one of the keenest pleasures of 
reading&mdash;the being beforehand with your author, and going 
shares with him in his own thoughts.</p>
<p>If it be said that it is manifestly unfair to compare a 
mystical writer like Emerson with a polemical or historical one, 
I am not concerned to answer the objection, for let the 
comparison be made with whom you will, the unparalleled 
non-sequaciousness of Emerson is as certain as the Correggiosity 
of Correggio.&nbsp; You never know what he will be at.&nbsp; His 
sentences fall over you in glittering cascades, beautiful and 
bright, and for the moment refreshing, but after a very brief 
while the mind, having nothing to do on its own account but to 
remain wide open, and see what Emerson sends it, grows first 
restive and then torpid.&nbsp; Admiration gives way to 
astonishment, astonishment to bewilderment, and bewilderment to 
stupefaction.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Napoleon is not a man, but a system,&rsquo; once said, 
in her most impressive tones, Madame de Sta&euml;l to Sir James 
Mackintosh, across a dinner-table.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Magnificent!&rsquo; murmured Sir James.&nbsp; &lsquo;But 
what does she mean?&rsquo; whispered one of those helplessly 
commonplace creatures who, like the present writer, go about 
spoiling everything.&nbsp; <!-- page 225--><a 
name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
225</span>&lsquo;Mass!&nbsp; I cannot tell!&rsquo; was the frank 
acknowledgment and apt Shakspearian quotation of 
Mackintosh.&nbsp; Emerson&rsquo;s meaning, owing to his 
non-sequacious style, is often very difficult to apprehend.&nbsp;
Hear him for a moment on &lsquo;Experience&rsquo;:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I gossip for my hour concerning the eternal
politic.&nbsp; I have seen many fair pictures, not in vain.&nbsp;
A wonderful time I have lived in.&nbsp; I am not the novice I was
fourteen, nor yet seven years ago.&nbsp; Let who will ask, Where 
is the fruit?&nbsp; I find a private fruit sufficient.&nbsp; This
is a fruit, that I should not ask for a rash effect from 
meditations, counsels, and the hiving of truths.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This surely is an odd way of hiving truths.&nbsp; It follows 
from it that Emerson is more striking than suggestive.&nbsp; He 
likes things on a large scale&mdash;he is fond of ethnical 
remarks and typical persons.&nbsp; Notwithstanding his habit of 
introducing the names of common things into his discourses and 
poetry (&lsquo;Hay, corn, roots, hemp, flax, apples, wool, and 
wood,&rsquo; is a line from one of his poems), his familiarity 
therewith is evidently not great.&nbsp; &lsquo;Take care, 
papa,&rsquo; cried his little son, seeing him at work with his 
spade, &lsquo;you will dig your leg.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 226--><a name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
226</span>His essay on <i>Friendship</i> will not be found 
satisfactory.&nbsp; Here is a subject on which surely we are 
entitled to &lsquo;body.&rsquo;&nbsp; The <i>Over Soul</i> was 
different; <i>there</i> it was easy to agree with Carlyle, who, 
writing to Emerson, says: &lsquo;Those voices of yours which I 
likened to unembodied souls and censure sometimes for having no 
body&mdash;how <i>can</i> they have a body?&nbsp; They are light 
rays darting upwards in the east!&rsquo;&nbsp; But friendship is 
a word the very sight of which in print makes the heart 
warm.&nbsp; One remembers Elia: &lsquo;Oh! it is pleasant as it 
is rare to find the same arm linked in yours at forty which at 
thirteen helped it to turn over the Cicero <i>De 
Amiciti&acirc;</i>, or some other tale of antique friendship 
which the young heart even then was burning to 
anticipate.&rsquo;&nbsp; With this in your ear it is rather 
chilling to read, &lsquo;I do, then, with my friends as I do with
my books.&nbsp; I would have them where I can find them, but I 
seldom use them.&nbsp; We must have society on our own terms, and
admit or exclude it on the slightest cause.&nbsp; I cannot afford
to speak much with my friend.&rsquo;&nbsp; These are not genial 
terms.</p>
<p>For authors and books his affection, real as it was, was 
singularly impersonal.&nbsp; In his treatment of literary 
subjects, we miss the purely <!-- page 227--><a 
name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 227</span>human 
touch, the grip of affection, the accent of scorn, that so 
pleasantly characterize the writings of Mr. Lowell.&nbsp; 
Emerson, it is to be feared, regarded a company of books but as a
congeries of ideas.&nbsp; For one idea he is indebted to Plato, 
for another to Dr. Channing.&nbsp; <i>Sartor Resartus</i>, so 
Emerson writes, is a noble philosophical poem, but &lsquo;have 
you read Sampson Read&rsquo;s <i>Growth of the 
Mind</i>?&rsquo;&nbsp; We read somewhere of &lsquo;Pindar, 
Raphael, Angelo, Dryden, and De Sta&euml;l.&rsquo;&nbsp; 
Emerson&rsquo;s notions of literary perspective are certainly 
&lsquo;very early.&rsquo;&nbsp; Dr. Holmes himself is every bit 
as bad.&nbsp; In this very book of his, speaking about the 
dangerous liberty some poets&mdash;Emerson amongst the 
number&mdash;take of crowding a redundant syllable into a line, 
he reminds us &lsquo;that Shakspeare and Milton knew how to use 
it effectively; Shelley employed it freely: Bryant indulged in 
it; Willis was fond of it.&rsquo;&nbsp; One has heard of the 
<i>Republic of Letters</i>, but this surely does not mean that 
one author is as good as another.&nbsp; &lsquo;Willis was fond of
it.&rsquo;&nbsp; I dare say he was, but we are not fond of 
Willis, and cannot help regarding the citation of his poetical 
example as an outrage.</p>
<p>None the less, if we will have but a little <!-- page 228--><a
name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 228</span>patience, 
and bid our occasional wonderment be still, and read Emerson at 
the right times and in small quantities, we shall not remain 
strangers to his charm.&nbsp; He bathes the universe in his 
thoughts.&nbsp; Nothing less than the Whole ever contented 
Emerson.&nbsp; His was no parochial spirit.&nbsp; He cries 
out:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;From air and ocean bring me foods,<br />
From all zones and altitudes.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How beautiful, too, are some of his sentences!&nbsp; Here is a
bit from his essay on Shakspeare in <i>Representative 
Men</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;It is the essence of poetry to spring like 
the rainbow daughter of Wonder from the invisible, to abolish the
past, and refuse all history.&nbsp; Malone, Warburton, Dyce, and 
Collier have wasted their life.&nbsp; The famed theatres have 
vainly assisted.&nbsp; Betterton, Garrick, Kemble, Kean, and 
Macready dedicate their lives to his genius&mdash;him they crown,
elucidate, obey, and express&mdash;the genius knows them 
not.&nbsp; The recitation begins, <i>one golden word leaps out 
immortal from all this painful pedantry</i>, <i>and sweetly 
torments us with invitations to his own inaccessible 
homes</i>.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The words we have ventured to italicize seem <!-- page 
229--><a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 229</span>to
us to be of surpassing beauty, and to express what many a 
play-goer of late years must often have dimly felt.</p>
<p>Patience should indeed be the motto for any Emerson reader who
is not by nature &lsquo;author&rsquo;s kin.&rsquo;&nbsp; For 
example, in the essay on <i>Character</i>, after reading, 
&lsquo;Everything in nature is bipolar, or has a positive and 
negative pole.&nbsp; There is a male and a female, a spirit and a
fact, a north and a south.&nbsp; Spirit is the positive, the 
event is the negative; will is the north, action the south 
pole.&nbsp; Character may be ranked as having its natural place 
in the north&rsquo;&mdash;how easy to lay the book down and read 
no more that day; but a moment&rsquo;s patience is amply 
rewarded, for but sixteen lines farther on we may read as 
follows: &lsquo;We boast our emancipation from many 
superstitions, but if we have broken any idols it is through a 
transfer of the idolatry.&nbsp; What have I gained that I no 
longer immolate a bull to Jove or to Neptune, or a mouse to 
Hecate; that I do not tremble before the Eumenides or the 
Catholic Purgatory, or the Calvinistic Judgment Day&mdash;if I 
quake at opinion, the public opinion as we call it, or the threat
of assault or contumely, or bad neighbours, or poverty, or 
mutilation, or at the <!-- page 230--><a name="page230"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 230</span>rumour of revolution or of 
wonder!&nbsp; If I quake, what matters it what I quake 
at?&rsquo;&nbsp; Well and truly did Carlyle write to Emerson, 
&lsquo;You are a new era, my man, in your huge 
country.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Emerson&rsquo;s poetry has at least one of the qualities of 
true poetry&mdash;it always pleases and occasionally 
delights.&nbsp; Great poetry it may not be, but it has the happy 
knack of slipping in between our fancies, and of clinging like 
ivy to the masonry of the thought-structure beneath which each 
one of us has his dwelling.&nbsp; I must be allowed room for two 
quotations, one from the stanzas called <i>Give all to Love</i>, 
the other from <i>Wood Notes</i>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Cling with life to the maid;<br />
But when the surprise,<br />
First shadow of surmise,<br />
Flits across her bosom young<br />
Of a joy apart from thee,<br />
Free be she, fancy-free,<br />
Nor thou detain her vesture&rsquo;s hem,<br />
Nor the palest rose she flung<br />
From her summer&rsquo;s diadem.<br />
Though thou loved her as thyself,<br />
As a self of purer clay,<br />
Though her parting dims the day,<br />
Stealing grace from all alive;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Heartily know<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When half-gods go,<br />
The gods arrive.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 231--><a name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
231</span>The lines from <i>Wood Notes</i> run as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Come learn with me the fatal song<br />
Which knits the world in music strong,<br />
Whereto every bosom dances,<br />
Kindled with courageous fancies;<br />
Come lift thine eyes to lofty rhymes<br />
Of things with things, of times with times,<br />
Primal chimes of sun and shade,<br />
Of sound and echo, man and maid;<br />
The land reflected in the flood;<br />
Body with shadow still pursued.<br />
For nature beats in perfect tune<br />
And rounds with rhyme her every rune;<br />
Whether she work in land or sea<br />
Or hide underground her alchemy.<br />
Thou canst not wave thy staff in air,<br />
Or dip thy paddle in the lake,<br />
But it carves the bow of beauty there,<br />
And the ripples in rhymes the oar forsake.<br />
Not unrelated, unaffied,<br />
But to each thought and thing allied,<br />
Is perfect nature&rsquo;s every part,<br />
Rooted in the mighty heart.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What place Emerson is to occupy in American literature is for 
America to determine.&nbsp; Some authoritative remarks on this 
subject are to be found in Mr. Lowell&rsquo;s essay on 
&lsquo;Thoreau,&rsquo; in <i>My Study Windows</i>; but here at 
home, where we are sorely pressed for room, it is certain he must
be content with a small allotment, where, <!-- page 232--><a 
name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 232</span>however, he
may for ever sit beneath his own vine and fig-tree, none daring 
to make him afraid.&nbsp; Emerson will always be the favourite 
author of somebody; and to be always read by somebody is better 
than to be read first by everybody and then by nobody.&nbsp; 
Indeed, it is hard to fancy a pleasanter destiny than to join the
company of lesser authors.&nbsp; All their readers are sworn 
friends.&nbsp; They are spared the harsh discords of ill-judged 
praise and feigned rapture.&nbsp; Once or twice in a century some
enthusiastic and expansive admirer insists upon dragging them 
from their shy retreats, and trumpeting their fame in the 
market-place, asserting, possibly with loud asseverations (after 
the fashion of Mr. Swinburne), that they are precisely as much 
above Otway and Collins and George Eliot as they are below 
Shakespeare and Hugo and Emily Bront&euml;.&nbsp; The great world
looks on good-humouredly for a moment or two, and then proceeds 
as before, and the disconcerted author is left free to scuttle 
back to his corner, where he is all the happier, sharing the 
raptures of the lonely student, for his brief experience of 
publicity.</p>
<p>Let us bid farewell to Emerson, who has bidden farewell to the
world in the words of his own <i>Good-bye</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 233--><a name="page233"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 233</span>&lsquo;Good-bye to flattery&rsquo;s 
fawning face,<br />
To grandeur with his wise grimace,<br />
To upstart wealth&rsquo;s averted eye,<br />
To supple office low and high,<br />
To crowded halls, to court and street,<br />
To frozen hearts and hasting feet,<br />
To those who go and those who come,&mdash;<br />
Good-bye, proud world, I&rsquo;m going home,<br />
I am going to my own hearth-stone<br />
Bosomed in yon green hills, alone,<br />
A secret nook in a pleasant land,<br />
Whose groves the frolic fairies planned;<br />
Where arches green the livelong day<br />
Echo the blackbird&rsquo;s roundelay,<br />
And vulgar feet have never trod,<br />
A spot that is sacred to thought and God.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><!-- page 234--><a name="page234"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 234</span>THE OFFICE OF LITERATURE.</h2>
<p>Dr. John Brown&rsquo;s pleasant story has become well known, 
of the countryman who, being asked to account for the gravity of 
his dog, replied, &lsquo;Oh, sir! life is full of sairiousness to
him&mdash;he can just never get eneugh o&rsquo; 
fechtin&rsquo;.&rsquo;&nbsp; Something of the spirit of this 
saddened dog seems lately to have entered into the very people 
who ought to be freest from it&mdash;our men of letters.&nbsp; 
They are all very serious and very quarrelsome.&nbsp; To some of 
them it is dangerous even to allude.&nbsp; Many are wedded to a 
theory or period, and are the most uxorious of 
husbands&mdash;ever ready to resent an affront to their 
lady.&nbsp; This devotion makes them very grave, and possibly 
very happy after a pedantic fashion.&nbsp; One remembers what 
Hazlitt, who was neither happy nor pedantic, has said about 
pedantry:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The power of attaching an interest to the 
most trifling or painful pursuits is one of the <!-- page 
235--><a name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
235</span>greatest happinesses of our nature.&nbsp; The common 
soldier mounts the breach with joy, the miser deliberately 
starves himself to death, the mathematician sets about extracting
the cube-root with a feeling of enthusiasm, and the lawyer sheds 
tears of delight over <i>Coke upon Lyttleton</i>.&nbsp; He who is
not in some measure a pedant, though he may be a wise, cannot be 
a very happy man.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Possibly not; but then we are surely not content that our 
authors should be pedants in order that they may be happy and 
devoted.&nbsp; As one of the great class for whose sole use and 
behalf literature exists&mdash;the class of readers&mdash;I 
protest that it is to me a matter of indifference whether an 
author is happy or not.&nbsp; I want him to make me happy.&nbsp; 
That is his office.&nbsp; Let him discharge it.</p>
<p>I recognise in this connection the corresponding truth of what
Sydney Smith makes his Peter Plymley say about the private 
virtues of Mr. Perceval, the Prime Minister:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;You spend a great deal of ink about the 
character of the present Prime Minister.&nbsp; Grant all that you
write&mdash;I say, I fear that he will ruin Ireland, and pursue a
line of policy destructive to the true interests of his country; 
<!-- page 236--><a name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
236</span>and then you tell me that he is faithful to Mrs. 
Perceval, and kind to the Master Percevals.&nbsp; I should prefer
that he whipped his boys and saved his country.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We should never confuse functions or apply wrong tests.&nbsp; 
What can books do for us?&nbsp; Dr. Johnson, the least pedantic 
of men, put the whole matter into a nutshell (a cocoanut shell, 
if you will&mdash;Heaven forbid that I should seek to compress 
the great Doctor within any narrower limits than my metaphor 
requires!), when he wrote that a book should teach us either to 
enjoy life or endure it.&nbsp; &lsquo;Give us 
enjoyment!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Teach us endurance!&rsquo;&nbsp; 
Hearken to the ceaseless demand and the perpetual prayer of an 
ever unsatisfied and always suffering humanity!</p>
<p>How is a book to answer the ceaseless demand?</p>
<p>Self-forgetfulness is of the essence of enjoyment, and the 
author who would confer pleasure must possess the art, or know 
the trick, of destroying for the time the reader&rsquo;s own 
personality.&nbsp; Undoubtedly the easiest way of doing this is 
by the creation of a host of rival personalities&mdash;hence the 
number and the popularity of novels.&nbsp; Whenever a novelist 
fails his <!-- page 237--><a name="page237"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 237</span>book is said to flag; that is, the 
reader suddenly (as in skating) comes bump down upon his own 
personality, and curses the unskilful author.&nbsp; No lack of 
characters and continual motion is the easiest recipe for a 
novel, which, like a beggar, should always be kept &lsquo;moving 
on.&rsquo;&nbsp; Nobody knew this better than Fielding, whose 
novels, like most good ones, are full of inns.</p>
<p>When those who are addicted to what is called &lsquo;improving
reading&rsquo; inquire of you petulantly why you cannot find 
change of company and scene in books of travel, you should answer
cautiously that when books of travel are full of inns, 
atmosphere, and motion, they are as good as any novel; nor is 
there any reason in the nature of things why they should not 
always be so, though experience proves the contrary.</p>
<p>The truth or falsehood of a book is immaterial.&nbsp; George 
Borrow&rsquo;s <i>Bible in Spain</i> is, I suppose, true; though 
now that I come to think of it, in what is to me a new light, one
remembers that it contains some odd things.&nbsp; But was not 
Borrow the accredited agent of the British and Foreign Bible 
Society?&nbsp; Did he not travel (and he had a free hand) at 
their charges?&nbsp; Was he not befriended by our minister at 
<!-- page 238--><a name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
238</span>Madrid, Mr. Villiers, subsequently Earl of Clarendon in
the peerage of England?&nbsp; It must be true; and yet at this 
moment I would as lief read a chapter of the <i>Bible in 
Spain</i> as I would <i>Gil Blas</i>; nay, I positively would 
give the preference to Don Jorge.</p>
<p>Nobody can sit down to read Borrow&rsquo;s books without as 
completely forgetting himself as if he were a boy in the forest 
with Gurth and Wamba.</p>
<p>Borrow is provoking, and has his full share of faults, and, 
though the owner of a style, is capable of excruciating 
offences.&nbsp; His habitual use of the odious word 
&lsquo;individual&rsquo; as a noun-substantive (seven times in 
three pages of <i>The Romany Rye</i>) elicits the frequent groan,
and he is certainly once guilty of calling fish the &lsquo;finny 
tribe.&rsquo;&nbsp; He believed himself to be animated by an 
intense hatred of the Church of Rome, and disfigures many of his 
pages by Lawrence-Boythorn-like tirades against that institution;
but no Catholic of sense need on this account deny himself the 
pleasure of reading Borrow, whose one dominating passion was 
<i>camaraderie</i>, and who hob-a-nobbed in the friendliest 
spirit with priest and gipsy in a fashion as far beyond praise as
it is beyond description by any pen <!-- page 239--><a 
name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 239</span>other than 
his own.&nbsp; Hail to thee, George Borrow!&nbsp; Cervantes 
himself, Gil Blas, do not more effectually carry their readers 
into the land of the Cid than does this miraculous agent of the 
Bible Society, by favour of whose pleasantness we can, any hour 
of the week, enter Villafranca by night, or ride into Galicia on 
an Andalusian stallion (which proved to be a foolish thing to 
do), without costing anybody a <i>peseta</i>, and at no risk 
whatever to our necks&mdash;be they long or short.</p>
<p>Cooks, warriors, and authors must be judged by the effects 
they produce: toothsome dishes, glorious victories, pleasant 
books&mdash;these are our demands.&nbsp; We have nothing to do 
with ingredients, tactics, or methods.&nbsp; We have no desire to
be admitted into the kitchen, the council, or the study.&nbsp; 
The cook may clean her saucepans how she pleases&mdash;the 
warrior place his men as he likes&mdash;the author handle his 
material or weave his plot as best he can&mdash;when the dish is 
served we only ask, Is it good? when the battle has been fought, 
Who won? when the book comes out, Does it read?</p>
<p>Authors ought not to be above being reminded that it is their 
first duty to write agreeably&mdash;some very disagreeable men 
have succeeded <!-- page 240--><a name="page240"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 240</span>in doing so, and there is therefore 
no need for anyone to despair.&nbsp; Every author, be he grave or
gay, should try to make his book as ingratiating as 
possible.&nbsp; Reading is not a duty, and has consequently no 
business to be made disagreeable.&nbsp; Nobody is under any 
obligation to read any other man&rsquo;s book.</p>
<p>Literature exists to please&mdash;to lighten the burden of 
men&rsquo;s lives; to make them for a short while forget their 
sorrows and their sins, their silenced hearths, their 
disappointed hopes, their grim futures&mdash;and those men of 
letters are the best loved who have best performed 
literature&rsquo;s truest office.&nbsp; Their name is happily 
legion, and I will conclude these disjointed remarks by quoting 
from one of them, as honest a parson as ever took tithe or voted 
for the Tory candidate, the Rev. George Crabbe.&nbsp; Hear him in
<i>The Frank Courtship</i>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I must be loved;&rdquo; said Sybil; 
&ldquo;I must see<br />
The man in terrors, who aspires to me:<br />
At my forbidding frown his heart must ache,<br />
His tongue must falter, and his frame must shake;<br />
And if I grant him at my feet to kneel,<br />
What trembling fearful pleasure must he feel:<br />
Nay, such the raptures that my smiles inspire,<br />
That reason&rsquo;s self must for a time retire.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 241--><a name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
241</span>&ldquo;Alas! for good Josiah,&rdquo; said the dame,<br 
/>
&ldquo;These wicked thoughts would fill his soul with shame;<br 
/>
He kneel and tremble at a thing of dust!<br />
He cannot, child:&rdquo;&mdash;the child replied, &ldquo;He 
must.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Were an office to be opened for the insurance of literary 
reputations, no critic at all likely to be in the society&rsquo;s
service would refuse the life of a poet who could write like 
Crabbe.&nbsp; Cardinal Newman, Mr. Leslie Stephen, Mr. Swinburne,
are not always of the same way of thinking, but all three hold 
the one true faith about Crabbe.</p>
<p>But even were Crabbe now left unread, which is very far from 
being the case, his would be an enviable fame&mdash;for was he 
not one of the favourite poets of Walter Scott, and whenever the 
closing scene of the great magician&rsquo;s life is read in the 
pages of Lockhart, must not Crabbe&rsquo;s name be brought upon 
the reader&rsquo;s quivering lip?</p>
<p>To soothe the sorrow of the soothers of sorrow, to bring tears
to the eyes and smiles to the cheeks of the lords of human smiles
and tears, is no mean ministry, and it is Crabbe&rsquo;s.</p>
<h2><!-- page 242--><a name="page242"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 242</span>WORN-OUT TYPES.</h2>
<p>It is now a complaint of quite respectably antiquity that the 
types in which humanity was originally set up by a humour-loving 
Providence are worn out and require recasting.&nbsp; The surface 
of society has become smooth.&nbsp; It ought to be a 
bas-relief&mdash;it is a plane.&nbsp; Even a Chaucer (so it is 
said) could make nothing of us as we wend our way to 
Brighton.&nbsp; We have tempers, it is true&mdash;bad ones for 
the most part; but no humours to be in or out of.&nbsp; We are 
all far too much alike; we do not group well; we only mix.&nbsp; 
All this, and more, is alleged against us.&nbsp; A 
cheerfully-disposed person might perhaps think that, assuming the
prevailing type to be a good, plain, readable one, this 
uniformity need not necessarily be a bad thing; but had he the 
courage to give expression to this opinion he would most 
certainly be at once told, with that mixture of asperity and 
contempt so <!-- page 243--><a name="page243"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 243</span>properly reserved for those who take
cheerful views of anything, that without well-defined types of 
character there can be neither national comedy nor whimsical 
novel; and as it is impossible to imagine any person sufficiently
cheerful to carry the argument further by inquiring ingenuously, 
&lsquo;And how would that matter?&rsquo; the position of things 
becomes serious, and demands a few minutes&rsquo; 
investigation.</p>
<p>As we said at the beginning, the complaint is an old 
one&mdash;most complaints are.&nbsp; When Montaigne was in Rome 
in 1580 he complained bitterly that he was always knocking up 
against his own countrymen, and might as well have been in 
Paris.&nbsp; And yet some people would have you believe that this
curse of the Continent is quite new.&nbsp; More than seventy 
years ago that most quotable of English authors, Hazlitt, wrote 
as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;It is, indeed, the evident tendency of all 
literature to generalize and dissipate character by giving men 
the same artificial education and the same common stock of ideas;
so that we see all objects from the same point of view, and 
through the same reflected medium; we learn to exist not in 
ourselves, but in books; all men become alike, mere 
readers&mdash;spectators, <!-- page 244--><a 
name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 244</span>not actors 
in the scene and lose all proper personal identity.&nbsp; The 
templar&mdash;the wit&mdash;the man of pleasure and the man of 
fashion, the courtier and the citizen, the knight and the squire,
the lover and the miser&mdash;Lovelace, Lothario, Will Honeycomb 
and Sir Roger de Coverley, Sparkish and Lord Foppington, Western 
and Tom Jones, my Father and my Uncle Toby, Millament and Sir 
Sampson Legend, Don Quixote and Sancho, Gil Blas and Guzman 
d&rsquo;Alfarache, Count Fathom and Joseph Surface&mdash;have all
met and exchanged commonplaces on the barren plains of the 
<i>haute litt&eacute;rature</i>&mdash;toil slowly on to the 
Temple of Science, seen a long way off upon a level, and end in 
one dull compound of politics, criticism, chemistry, and 
metaphysics.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Very pretty writing, certainly; <a name="citation244"></a><a 
href="#footnote244" class="citation">[244]</a> nor can it be 
disputed that uniformity of surroundings puts a tax upon 
originality.&nbsp; To make bricks and find your own straw are 
terms of bondage.&nbsp; Modern <!-- page 245--><a 
name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 245</span>characters,
like modern houses, are possibly built too much on the same 
lines, Dickens&rsquo;s description of Coketown is not easily 
forgotten:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;All the public inscriptions in the town 
were painted alike, in severe characters of black and 
white.&nbsp; The jail might have been the infirmary, the 
infirmary might have been the jail, the town hall might have been
either, or both, or anything else, for anything that appeared to 
the contrary in the graces of their construction.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the inhabitants of Coketown are exposed to the same 
objection as their buildings.&nbsp; Every one sinks all traces of
what he vulgarly calls &lsquo;the shop&rsquo; (that is, his 
lawful calling), and busily pretends to be nothing.&nbsp; 
Distinctions of dress are found irksome.&nbsp; A barrister of 
feeling hates to be seen in his robes save when actually engaged 
in a case.&nbsp; An officer wears his uniform only when 
obliged.&nbsp; Doctors have long since shed all outward signs of 
their healing art.&nbsp; Court dress excites a smile.&nbsp; A 
countess in her jewels is reckoned indecent by the British 
workman, who, all unemployed, puffs his tobacco smoke against the
window-pane of the carriage that is conveying her ladyship to a 
drawing-room; and a West-end clergyman is with difficulty <!-- 
page 246--><a name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
246</span>restrained from telling his congregation what he had 
been told the British workman said on that occasion.&nbsp; Had he
but had the courage to repeat those stirring words, his hearers 
(so he said) could hardly have failed to have felt their 
force&mdash;so unusual in such a place; but he had not the 
courage, and that sermon of the pavement remains 
unpreached.&nbsp; The toe of the peasant is indeed kibing the 
heel of the courtier.&nbsp; The passion for equality in externals
cannot be denied.&nbsp; We are all woven strangely in the same 
piece, and so it comes about that, though our modern society has 
invented new callings, those callings have not created new 
types.&nbsp; Stockbrokers, directors, official liquidators, 
philanthropists, secretaries&mdash;not of State, but of 
companies&mdash;speculative builders, are a new kind of people 
known to many&mdash;indeed, playing a great part among 
us&mdash;but who, for all that, have not enriched the stage with 
a single character.&nbsp; Were they to disappear to-morrow, to be
blown dancing away like the leaves before Shelley&rsquo;s west 
wind, where in reading or playgoing would posterity encounter 
them?&nbsp; Alone amongst the children of men, the pale student 
of the law, burning the midnight oil in some one of the 
&lsquo;high lonely towers&rsquo; <!-- page 247--><a 
name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 247</span>recently 
built by the Benchers of the Middle Temple (in the Italian 
taste), would, whilst losing his youth over that interminable 
series, <i>The Law Reports</i>, every now and again strike across
the old track, once so noisy with the bayings of the well-paid 
hounds of justice, and, pushing his way along it, trace the 
history of the bogus company, from the acclamations attendant 
upon its illegitimate birth to the hour of disgrace when it dies 
by strangulation at the hands of the professional wrecker.&nbsp; 
The pale student will not be a wholly unsympathetic reader.&nbsp;
Great swindles have ere now made great reputations, and lawyers 
may surely be permitted to take a pensive interest in such 
matters.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Not one except the Attorney was 
amused&mdash;<br />
He, like Achilles, faithful to the tomb,<br />
So there were quarrels, cared not for the cause,<br />
Knowing they must be settled by the laws.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But our elder dramatists would not have let any of these 
characters swim out of their ken.&nbsp; A glance over Ben Jonson,
Massinger, Beaumont and Fletcher, is enough to reveal their frank
and easy method.&nbsp; Their characters, like an 
apothecary&rsquo;s drugs, wear labels round their necks.&nbsp; 
Mr. Justice Clement and Mr. <!-- page 248--><a 
name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 248</span>Justice 
Greedy; Master Matthew, the town gull; Sir Giles Overreach, Sir

us the heroes of our modern society?&nbsp; Ought we to 
have&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Sir Moses, Sir Aaron, Sir Jamramagee,<br />
Two stock-jobbing Jews, and a shuffling Parsee&rsquo;?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Baron Contango, the Hon. Mr. Guinea-Pig, poor Miss Impulsia 
Allottee, Mr. Jeremiah Builder&mdash;Rare Old Ben, who was fond 
of the city, would have given us them all and many more; but 
though we may well wish he were here to do it, we ought, I think,
to confess that the humour of these typical persons who so swell 
the <i>dramatis person&aelig;</i>; of an Elizabethan is, to say 
the least of it, far to seek.&nbsp; There is a certain 
warm-hearted tradition about their very names which makes 
disrespect painful.&nbsp; It seems a churl&rsquo;s part not to 
laugh, as did our fathers before us, at the humours of the 
conventional parasite or impossible serving-man; but we laugh 
because we will, and not because we must.</p>
<p>Genuine comedy&mdash;the true tickling scene, exquisite 
absurdity, soul-rejoicing incongruity&mdash;<!-- page 249--><a 
name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 249</span>has really 
nothing to do with types, prevailing fashions, and such-like 
vulgarities.&nbsp; Sir Andrew Aguecheek is not a typical fool; he
<i>is</i> a fool, seised in fee simple of his folly.</p>
<p>Humour lies not in generalizations, but in the individual; not
in his hat nor in his hose, even though the latter be 
&lsquo;cross-gartered&rsquo;; but in the deep heart of him, in 
his high-flying vanities, his low-lying oddities&mdash;what we 
call his &lsquo;ways&rsquo;&mdash;nay, in the very motions of his
back as he crosses the road.&nbsp; These stir our laughter whilst
he lives and our tears when he dies, for in mourning over him we 
know full well we are taking part in our own obsequies.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;But indeed,&rsquo; wrote Charles Lamb, &lsquo;we die many 
deaths before we die, and I am almost sick when I think that such
a hold as I had of you is gone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Literature is but the reflex of life, and the humour of it 
lies in the portrayal of the individual, not the type; and though
the young man in <i>Locksley Hall</i> no doubt observes that the 
&lsquo;individual withers,&rsquo; we have but to take down George
Meredith&rsquo;s novels to find the fact is otherwise, and that 
we have still one amongst us who takes notes, and against the 
battery of whose quick wits even the costly raiment of Poole is 
no protection.&nbsp; We are forced as we <!-- page 250--><a 
name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 250</span>read to 
exclaim with Petruchio: &lsquo;Thou hast hit it; come sit on 
me.&rsquo;&nbsp; No doubt the task of the modern humorist is not 
so easy as it was.&nbsp; The surface ore has been mostly picked 
up.&nbsp; In order to win the precious metal you must now work 
with in-stroke and out-stroke after the most approved 
methods.&nbsp; Sometimes one would enjoy it a little more if we 
did not hear quite so distinctly the snorting of the engine, and 
the groaning and the creaking of the gear as it painfully winds 
up its prize: but what would you?&nbsp; Methods, no less than 
men, must have the defects of their qualities.</p>
<p>If, therefore, it be the fact that our national comedy is in 
decline, we must look for some other reasons for it than those 
suggested by Hazlitt in 1817.&nbsp; When Mr. Chadband inquired, 
&lsquo;Why can we not fly, my friends?&rsquo; Mr. Snagsby 
ventured to observe, &lsquo;in a cheerful and rather knowing 
tone, &ldquo;No wings!&rdquo;&rsquo; but he was immediately 
frowned down by Mrs. Snagsby.&nbsp; We lack courage to suggest 
that the somewhat heavy-footed movements of our recent dramatists
are in any way due to their not being provided with those twin 
adjuncts indispensable for the genius who would soar.</p>
<h2><!-- page 251--><a name="page251"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 251</span>CAMBRIDGE AND THE POETS.</h2>
<p>Why all the English poets, with a barely decent number of 
exceptions, have been Cambridge men, has always struck me, as did
the abstinence of the Greeks from malt Mr. Calverley, &lsquo;as 
extremely curious.&rsquo;&nbsp; But in this age of detail, one 
must, however reluctantly, submit to prove one&rsquo;s facts, and
I, therefore, propose to institute a &lsquo;Modest Inquiry&rsquo;
into this subject.&nbsp; Imaginatively, I shall don proctorial 
robes, and armed with a duster, saunter up and down the library, 
putting to each poet as I meet him the once dreaded question, 
&lsquo;Sir, are you a member of this University?&rsquo;</p>
<p>But whilst I am arranging myself for this function, let me 
utilize the time by making two preliminary observations&mdash;the
first one being that, as to-day is Sunday, only such free 
libraries are open as may happen to be attached to public-houses,
and I am consequently confined <!-- page 252--><a 
name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 252</span>to my own 
poor shelves, and must be forgiven even though I make some 
palpable omissions.&nbsp; The second is that I exclude from my 
survey living authors.&nbsp; I must do so; their very names would
excite controversy about a subject which, when wisely handled, 
admits of none.</p>
<p>I now pursue my inquiry.&nbsp; That Chaucer was a Cambridge 
man cannot be proved.&nbsp; It is the better opinion that he was 
(how else should he have known anything about the Trumpington 
Road?), but it is only an opinion, and as no one has ever been 
found reckless enough to assert that he was an Oxford man, he 
must be content to &lsquo;sit out&rsquo; this inquiry along with 
Shakspeare, Webster, Ford, Pope, Cowper, Burns, and Keats, no one
of whom ever kept his terms at either University.&nbsp; Spenser 
is, of course, the glory of the Cambridge Pembroke, though were 
the fellowships of that college made to depend upon passing a 
yearly examination in the <i>Faerie Queen</i>, to be conducted by
Dean Church, there would be wailing and lamentation within her 
rubicund walls.&nbsp; Sir Thomas Wyatt was at St. John&rsquo;s, 
Fulke Greville Lord Brooke at Jesus, Giles and Phineas Fletcher 
were at King&rsquo;s, Herrick was first at St. John&rsquo;s, but 
migrated to the Hall, <!-- page 253--><a name="page253"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 253</span>where he is still reckoned very 
pretty reading, even by boating men.&nbsp; Cowley, most 
precocious of poets, and Suckling were at Trinity, Waller at 
King&rsquo;s, Francis Quarles was of Christ&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The 
Herbert family were divided, some going to Oxford and some to 
Cambridge, George, of course, falling to the lot of 
Cambridge.&nbsp; John Milton&rsquo;s name alone would deify the 
University where he pursued his almost sacred studies.&nbsp; 
Andrew Marvell, a pleasant poet and savage satirist, was of 
Trinity.&nbsp; The author of <i>Hudibras</i> is frequently 
attributed to Cambridge, but, on being interrogated, he declined 
to name his college&mdash;always a suspicious circumstance.</p>
<p>I must not forget Richard Crashaw, of Peterhouse.&nbsp; 
Willingly would I relieve the intolerable tedium of this dry 
inquiry by transcribing the few lines of his now beneath my 
eye.&nbsp; But I forbear, and &lsquo;steer right on.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Of dramatists we find Marlowe (untimelier death than his was 
never any) at Corpus; Greene (I do not lay much stress on Greene)
was both at St. John&rsquo;s and Clare.&nbsp; Ben Jonson was at 
St. John&rsquo;s, so was Nash.&nbsp; John Fletcher (whose claims 
to be considered the senior partner in his well-known firm are 
simply <!-- page 254--><a name="page254"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 254</span>paramount) was at Corpus.&nbsp; 
James Shirley, the author of <i>The Maid&rsquo;s Revenge</i> and 
of the beautiful lyric beginning &lsquo;The glories of our birth 
and state,&rsquo; in the innocence of his heart first went to St.
John&rsquo;s College, Oxford, from whence he was speedily sent 
down, for reasons which the delightful author of <i>Athen&aelig; 
Oxonienses</i> must really be allowed to state for himself.&nbsp;
&lsquo;At the same time (1612) Dr. William Laud presiding at that
house, he had a very great affection for Shirley, especially for 
the pregnant parts that were visible in him, but then, having a 
broad or large mole upon his left cheek, which some esteemed a 
deformity, that worthy doctor would often tell him that he was an
unfit person to take the sacred function upon him, and should 
never have his consent to do so.&rsquo;&nbsp; Thus treated, 
Shirley left Oxford, that &lsquo;home of lost causes,&rsquo; but 
not apparently of large moles, and came to Cambridge, and entered
at St. Catharine&rsquo;s Hall, where, either because the 
authorities were not amongst those who esteemed a broad or large 
mole upon the left cheek to be a deformity, or because a mole, 
more or less, made no sort of difference in the personal 
appearance of the college, or for other good and sufficient 
reasons, poor Shirley was <!-- page 255--><a 
name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 255</span>allowed, 
without, I trust, being often told of his mole, to proceed to his
degree and to Holy Orders.</p>
<p>Starting off again, we find John Dryden, whose very name is a 
tower of strength (were he to come to life again he would, like 
Mr. Brown of Calaveras, &lsquo;clean out half the town&rsquo;), 
at Trinity.&nbsp; In this poet&rsquo;s later life he said he 
liked Oxford better.&nbsp; His lines on this subject are well 
known:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Oxford to him a dearer name shall be<br />
Than his own Mother-University.<br />
Thebes did his rude, unknowing youth engage,<br />
He chooses Athens in his riper age.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But idle preferences of this sort are beyond the scope of my 
present inquiry.&nbsp; After Dryden we find Garth at Peterhouse 
and charming Matthew Prior at John&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Then comes the 
great name of Gray.&nbsp; Perhaps I ought not to mention poor 
Christopher Smart, who was a Fellow of Pembroke; and yet the 
author of <i>David</i>, under happier circumstances, might have 
conferred additional poetic lustre even upon the college of 
Spenser. <a name="citation255"></a><a href="#footnote255" 
class="citation">[255]</a></p>
<p><!-- page 256--><a name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
256</span>In the present century, we find Byron and his bear at 
Trinity, Coleridge at Jesus, and Wordsworth at St. 
John&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The last-named poet was fully alive to the 
honour of belonging to the same University as Milton.&nbsp; In 
language not unworthy of Mr. Trumbull, the well-known auctioneer 
in <i>Middlemarch</i>, he has recorded as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Among the band of my compeers was one<br />
Whom chance had stationed in the very room<br />
Honoured by Milton&rsquo;s name.&nbsp; O temperate Bard,<br />
Be it confest that for the first time seated<br />
Within thy innocent lodge and oratory,<br />
One of a festive circle, I poured out<br />
Libations, to thy memory drank, till pride<br />
And gratitude grew dizzy in a brain<br />
Never excited by the fumes of wine<br />
Before that hour or since.&rsquo; <a name="citation256"></a><a 
href="#footnote256" class="citation">[256]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I know of no more amiable trait in the character of Cambridge 
men than their willingness to admit having been drunk 
<i>once</i>.</p>
<p>After the great name of Wordsworth any other must seem small, 
but I must, before concluding, place on record Praed, Macaulay, 
Kingsley, and Calverley.</p>
<p>A glorious Roll-call indeed!</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 257--><a name="page257"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 257</span>&lsquo;Earth shows to Heaven the 
names by thousands told<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That crown her fame.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So may Cambridge.</p>
<p>Oxford leads off with one I could find it in my heart to 
grudge her, beautiful as she is&mdash;Sir Philip Sidney.&nbsp; 
Why, I wonder, did he not accompany his friend and future 
biographer, Fulke Greville, to Cambridge?&nbsp; As Dr. Johnson 
once said to Boswell, &lsquo;Sir, you <i>may</i> 
wonder!&rsquo;&nbsp; Sidney most indisputably was at 
Christchurch.&nbsp; Old George Chapman, who I suppose was young 
once, was (I believe) at Oxford, though I have known Cambridge to
claim him.&nbsp; Lodge and Peele were at Oxford, so were Francis 
Beaumont and his brother Sir John.&nbsp; Philip Massinger, 
Shakerley Marmion, and John Marston are of Oxford, also Watson 
and Warner.&nbsp; Henry Vaughan the Silurist, Sir John Davies, 
George Sandys, Samuel Daniel, Dr. Donne, Lovelace, and Wither 
belong to the sister University, so did Dr. Brady&mdash;but 
Oxford must not claim all the merit of the metrical version of 
the Psalms, for Brady&rsquo;s colleague, Dr. Nahum Tate, was a 
Dublin man.&nbsp; Otway and Collins, Young, Johnson, Charles 
Wesley, Southey, Landor, Hartley Coleridge, Beddoes, Keble, Isaac
Williams, Faber, and Clough are names of <!-- page 258--><a 
name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 258</span>which their
University may well be proud.&nbsp; But surely, when compared 
with the Cambridge list, a falling-off must be admitted.</p>
<p>A poet indeed once came into residence at University College, 
whose single name&mdash;for, after all, poets must be weighed and
not counted&mdash;would have gone far to right the balance, but 
is Oxford bold enough to claim Shelley as her own?&nbsp; She sent
him down, not for riotous living, for no purer soul than his ever
haunted her courts, but for wanting to discuss with those whose 
business it was to teach him questions of high philosophy.&nbsp; 
Had Shelley only gone to Trinity in 1810, I feel sure wise and 
witty old Dr. Mansel would never have sent him down.&nbsp; 
Spenser, Milton, and Shelley!&nbsp; What a triad of immortal 
fames they would have made.&nbsp; As it is, we expect Oxford, 
with her accustomed composure, will insist upon adding Shelley to
her score&mdash;but even when she has been allowed to do so, she 
must own herself beaten both in men and metal.</p>
<p>But this being so&mdash;why was it so?&nbsp; It is now my turn
to own myself defeated.&nbsp; I cannot for the life of me tell 
how it happened.</p>
<h2>BOOK-BUYING.</h2>
<p><!-- page 259--><a name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
259</span>The most distinguished of living Englishmen, who, great
as he is in many directions, is perhaps inherently more a man of 
letters than anything else, has been overheard mournfully to 
declare that there were more booksellers&rsquo; shops in his 
native town sixty years ago, when he was a boy in it, than are 
to-day to be found within its boundaries.&nbsp; And yet the place
&lsquo;all unabashed&rsquo; now boasts its bookless self a 
city!</p>
<p>Mr. Gladstone was, of course, referring to second-hand 
bookshops.&nbsp; Neither he nor any other sensible man puts 
himself out about new books.&nbsp; When a new book is published, 
read an old one, was the advice of a sound though surly 
critic.&nbsp; It is one of the boasts of letters to have 
glorified the term &lsquo;second-hand,&rsquo; which other crafts 
have &lsquo;soiled to all ignoble use.&rsquo;&nbsp; But why it 
has been able to do this is obvious.&nbsp; All the best books are
necessarily second-hand.&nbsp; <!-- page 260--><a 
name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 260</span>The writers
of to-day need not grumble.&nbsp; Let them &lsquo;bide a 
wee.&rsquo;&nbsp; If their books are worth anything, they, too, 
one day will be second-hand.&nbsp; If their books are not worth 
anything there are ancient trades still in full operation amongst
us&mdash;the pastrycooks and the trunkmakers&mdash;who must have 
paper.</p>
<p>But is there any substance in the plaint that nobody now buys 
books, meaning thereby second-hand books?&nbsp; The late Mark 
Pattison, who had 16,000 volumes, and whose lightest word has 
therefore weight, once stated that he had been informed, and 
verily believed, that there were men of his own University of 
Oxford who, being in uncontrolled possession of annual incomes of
not less than &pound;500, thought they were doing the thing 
handsomely if they expended &pound;50 a year upon their 
libraries.&nbsp; But we are not bound to believe this unless we 
like.&nbsp; There was a touch of morosity about the late Rector 
of Lincoln which led him to take gloomy views of men, 
particularly Oxford men.</p>
<p>No doubt arguments <i>&agrave; priori</i> may readily be found
to support the contention that the habit of book-buying is on the
decline.&nbsp; I confess to knowing one or two men, not Oxford 
men <!-- page 261--><a name="page261"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 261</span>either, but Cambridge men (and the 
passion of Cambridge for literature is a by-word), who, on the 
plea of being pressed with business, or because they were going 
to a funeral, have passed a bookshop in a strange town without so
much as stepping inside &lsquo;just to see whether the fellow had
anything.&rsquo;&nbsp; But painful as facts of this sort 
necessarily are, any damaging inference we might feel disposed to
draw from them is dispelled by a comparison of price-lists.&nbsp;
Compare a bookseller&rsquo;s catalogue of 1862 with one of the 
present year, and your pessimism is washed away by the tears 
which unrestrainedly flow as you see what <i>bonnes fortunes</i> 
you have lost.&nbsp; A young book-buyer might well turn out upon 
Primrose Hill and bemoan his youth, after comparing old 
catalogues with new.</p>
<p>Nothing but American competition, grumble some old 
stagers.</p>
<p>Well! why not?&nbsp; This new battle for the books is a free 
fight, not a private one, and Columbia has &lsquo;joined 
in.&rsquo;&nbsp; Lower prices are not to be looked for.&nbsp; The
book-buyer of 1900 will be glad to buy at to-day&rsquo;s 
prices.&nbsp; I take pleasure in thinking he will not be able to 
do so.&nbsp; Good finds grow scarcer and scarcer.&nbsp; <!-- page
262--><a name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
262</span>True it is that but a few short weeks ago I picked up 
(such is the happy phrase, most apt to describe what was indeed a
&lsquo;street casualty&rsquo;) a copy of the original edition of 
<i>Endymion</i> (Keats&rsquo;s poem&mdash;O subscriber to 
Mudie&rsquo;s!&mdash;not Lord Beaconsfield&rsquo;s novel) for the
easy equivalent of half-a-crown&mdash;but then that was one of my
lucky days.&nbsp; The enormous increase of booksellers&rsquo; 
catalogues and their wide circulation amongst the trade has 
already produced a hateful uniformity of prices.&nbsp; Go where 
you will it is all the same to the odd sixpence.&nbsp; Time was 
when you could map out the country for yourself with some 
hopefulness of plunder.&nbsp; There were districts where the 
Elizabethan dramatists were but slenderly protected.&nbsp; A raid
into the &lsquo;bonnie North Countrie&rsquo; sent you home again 
cheered with chap-books and weighted with old pamphlets of 
curious interests; whilst the West of England seldom failed to 
yield a crop of novels.&nbsp; I remember getting a complete set 
of the Bront&euml; books in the original issues at Torquay, I may
say, for nothing.&nbsp; Those days are over.&nbsp; Your country 
bookseller is, in fact, more likely, such tales does he hear of 
London auctions, and such <!-- page 263--><a 
name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 263</span>catalogues 
does he receive by every post, to exaggerate the value of his 
wares than to part with them pleasantly, and as a country 
bookseller should, &lsquo;just to clear my shelves, you know, and
give me a bit of room.&rsquo;&nbsp; The only compensation for 
this is the catalogues themselves.&nbsp; You get <i>them</i>, at 
least, for nothing, and it cannot be denied that they make mighty
pretty reading.</p>
<p>These high prices tell their own tale, and force upon us the 
conviction that there never were so many private libraries in 
course of growth as there are to-day.</p>
<p>Libraries are not made; they grow.&nbsp; Your first two 
thousand volumes present no difficulty, and cost astonishingly 
little money.&nbsp; Given &pound;400 and five years, and an 
ordinary man can in the ordinary course, without undue haste or 
putting any pressure upon his taste, surround himself with this 
number of books, all in his own language, and thenceforward have 
at least one place in the world in which it is possible to be 
happy.&nbsp; But pride is still out of the question.&nbsp; To be 
proud of having two thousand books would be absurd.&nbsp; You 
might as well be proud of having two top coats.&nbsp; After your 
first two <!-- page 264--><a name="page264"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 264</span>thousand difficulty begins, but 
until you have ten thousand volumes the less you say about your 
library the better.&nbsp; <i>Then</i> you may begin to speak.</p>
<p>It is no doubt a pleasant thing to have a library left 
you.&nbsp; The present writer will disclaim no such legacy, but 
hereby undertakes to accept it, however dusty.&nbsp; But good as 
it is to inherit a library, it is better to collect one.&nbsp; 
Each volume then, however lightly a stranger&rsquo;s eye may roam
from shelf to shelf, has its own individuality, a history of its 
own.&nbsp; You remember where you got it, and how much you gave 
for it; and your word may safely be taken for the first of these 
facts, but not for the second.</p>
<p>The man who has a library of his own collection is able to 
contemplate himself objectively, and is justified in believing in
his own existence.&nbsp; No other man but he would have made 
precisely such a combination as his.&nbsp; Had he been in any 
single respect different from what he is, his library, as it 
exists, never would have existed.&nbsp; Therefore, surely he may 
exclaim, as in the gloaming he contemplates the backs of his 
loved ones, &lsquo;They are mine, and I am theirs.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 265--><a name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
265</span>But the eternal note of sadness will find its way even 
through the keyhole of a library.&nbsp; You turn some familiar 
page, of Shakspeare it may be, and his &lsquo;infinite 
variety,&rsquo; his &lsquo;multitudinous mind,&rsquo; suggests 
some new thought, and as you are wondering over it you think of 
Lycidas, your friend, and promise yourself the pleasure of having
his opinion of your discovery the very next time when by the fire
you two &lsquo;help waste a sullen day.&rsquo;&nbsp; Or it is, 
perhaps, some quainter, tenderer fancy that engages your solitary
attention, something in Sir Philip Sydney or Henry Vaughan, and 
then you turn to look for Phyllis, ever the best interpreter of 
love, human or divine.&nbsp; Alas! the printed page grows hazy 
beneath a filmy eye as you suddenly remember that Lycidas is 
dead&mdash;&lsquo;dead ere his prime&rsquo;&mdash;and that the 
pale cheek of Phyllis will never again be relumined by the white 
light of her pure enthusiasm.&nbsp; And then you fall to thinking
of the inevitable, and perhaps, in your present mood, not 
unwelcome hour, when the &lsquo;ancient peace&rsquo; of your old 
friends will be disturbed, when rude hands will dislodge them 
from their accustomed nooks and break up their goodly 
company.</p>

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
